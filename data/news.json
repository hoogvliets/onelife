    "summary": "<p><strong>OVO Hydro, Glasgow<br /></strong>Noah Sebastian\u2019s vocals switch deftly from croon to scream to whisper, but the genre-hopping US metalcore band lack chemistry on the big stage</p><p></p><p>Melodic metalcore band Bad Omens are pulling out all the stops for their first UK arena headline tour. In the first five minutes, we\u2019ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bring-me-the-horizon\">Bring Me the Horizon</a>, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.</p><p>Although tonight\u2019s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band\u2019s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum\u2019n\u2019bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian\u2019s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band\u2019s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&amp;B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/bad-omens-review-ovo-hydro-glasgow\">Continue reading...</a>",

They outfitted themselves in African prints, performed over the beat of a congo drum and advocated for populism in their verses.

Notably, Oyewole could not contribute to that album because he had been incarcerated for an attempted robbery of a Ku Klux Klan headquarters, serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence.

But with this independence came fresh conflicts, as the new Panamanian government refused to recognise Tulenega Shire, an autonomous Indigenous territory formed in 1870. The Guna people were subjugated under racist laws designed to erase their culture and pillage their land of resources. In February 1925, the local population, women included, took up arms in what is known as the San Blas rebellion against Panama\u2019s soldiers, a courageous fight that brought about independence for the region.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/bila-burba-review-panama-guna-people-battle-revolutionary-battles\">Continue reading...</a>",

In Vienna, the Jewish Knoller family must make some hard choices. While one brother is sent to stay in America, younger sibling Freddie (Lucas Lynggaard T\u00f8nnesen) must fend for himself as his parents opt to stay behind \u2013 a choice that is clearly not going to end well. While the film cuts back and forth between periods, we see Freddie on a death march with other Jewish prisoners in one timeframe, and trying to make his way to the UK via France in another.</p><p>In the westward-bound section, Freddie ends up in Paris, broke and desperate but eager for a bit of glamour all the same. An encounter with raffish but slippery Christos (Fernando Guallar), another immigrant, results in Freddie securing a job in the Op\u00e9ra neighbourhood persuading Nazi soldiers with his perfect fluent German to come to a nightclub he and Christos work for. This is how he hopes to raise enough money to pay for forged papers. What follows tracks closely to dozens of similar stories about Jews in exile in Europe during the second world war, compelled to keep their identities secret, and while the film is in fact based on the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/genocide-survivors-cambodia-rwanda-holocaust-memorial-day\">a real-life Freddie Knoller,</a> the cliched treatment rather drains it of the plausibility it needs to make it distinctive.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/desperate-journey-review-annabel-jankel\">Continue reading...</a>",

Is there a way we can use it to our advantage?</p><p>Fascia, the connective tissue that holds together the body\u2019s internal structure, really hasn\u2019t spent all that long in the limelight. Anatomists have known about its existence since before the Hippocratic oath was a thing, but until the 1980s it was routinely tossed in the bin during human dissections, regarded as little more than the wrapping that gets in the way of studying everything else. Over the past few decades, though, our understanding of it has evolved and (arguably) overshot \u2013 now, there are plenty of personal trainers who will insist that you should be loosening it up with a foam roller, or even harnessing its magical elastic powers to jump higher and do more press-ups. But what\u2019s it <em>really</em> doing \u2013 and is there a way you can actually take advantage of it?</p><p>\u201cThe easiest way to describe fascia is to think about the structure of a tangerine,\u201d says Natasha Kilian, a specialist in musculoskeletal physiotherapy at Pure Sports Medicine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the outer skin, and beneath that, the white pith that separates the segments and holds them together. Fascia works in a similar way: it\u2019s a continuous, all-encompassing network that wraps around and connects everything in the body, from muscles and nerves to blood vessels and organs. It\u2019s essentially the body\u2019s internal wetsuit, keeping everything supported and integrated.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever carved a joint of meat, it\u2019s the thin, silvery layer wrapped around the muscle, like clingfilm.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/24/secrets-of-the-body-what-is-fascia-health-foam-roller\">Continue reading...</a>",

Unlike home births, which have a midwife in attendance, free birth involves delivering without medical assistance.

Dita Parlo and Jean Dast\u00e9 play the newlyweds getting awkwardly accustomed to married life in close quarters, and their love story shapes the film.

Charlie Chaplin called him \u201cthe greatest actor in the world\u201d. He worked with the best European directors on some timeless films. As well as acting for Vigo, he played the timid man transformed by his affair with a sex worker in La Chienne (1931) and the incorrigible tramp in Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932) for Jean Renoir. He worked with Marcel Carn\u00e9 in films such as Le Quai des Brumes (1938), with Carl Theodor Dreyer in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), with Ren\u00e9 Clair, Marcel L\u2019Herbier, Julien Duvivier, GW Pabst \u2026 even John Frankenheimer in The Train (1964). \u201cWhen Michel Simon plays a part,\u201d said Truffaut, \u201cwe penetrate the core of the human heart.\u201d He spent five decades working in the cinema, starting out in the silents, and received his highest accolade, the Berlinale\u2019s Best Actor award in 1967, for his role as an antisemitic peasant befriending a young Jewish boy during the war in The Two of Us (Claude Berri). Reviewing that movie, Renata Adler called Simon \u201can enormous old genius \u2026 the general impression is that of an immense, thoughtful, warm-hearted and aquatic geological formation\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/michel-simon-latalante-jean-vigo\">Continue reading...</a>",

From a fashion point of view, it couldn\u2019t be more innocuous. It\u2019s got a crew neck. It\u2019s made from wool. It has a Fair Isle pattern at the upper yoke.

I love to kickstart December with Advent calendars for all the family, so it seemed only fair to taste test this lot with them in tow. And, despite an age range spanning 60-plus years, we were all pretty much on the same page with our expectations: we were looking for a bit of variety behind the doors, some Christmas sparkle and a hint of nostalgia. Packaging that looked the part when displayed on our mantelpiece was also an important consideration.</p><p>Despite the obvious biases (the kids being attracted to the calendars aimed at them v the adults preferring the slightly more elegant offerings), the results were pretty consistent. We all loved the calendars where there was something extra: a picture behind a door or a foil barrier to break through, a variation in the chocolates and so forth. Ultimately, that just goes to show that we\u2019re all big kids at heart \u2013 and that every day should start with a miniature chocolate treat.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/nov/22/best-chocolate-advent-calendars-uk\">Continue reading...</a>",

Even so, their camaraderie shines through as Brandy quickly breaks character to sway and sing along to Monica\u2019s Don\u2019t Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days), a showcase for her slightly raspy, soulful vocals during which she winds her hips and aims gun fingers at the audience.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/brandy-monica-concert-review-new-york\">Continue reading...</a>",

Yes, he\u2019s a \u201crecombinant\u201d \u2013 a lab-grown Na\u2019vi reboot of a man carved out of granite and patriotism \u2013 but he\u2019s also going through a full-blown existential wobble after discovering in the last instalment that he has a human son, Spider. \u201cQuaritch is undergoing an identity crisis,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cHis interest in the biological son of his biological precursor form is all about trying to define, \u2018Am I a completely new person? Am I bound by the rules and the behaviours of the person whose memories and personality I was imprinted with?\u2019 It\u2019s a true existential dilemma for him in the philosophical sense.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/21/quaritch-avatar-fire-and-ash-james-cameron-week-in-geek\">Continue reading...</a>",

It takes a spark of something dazzling, even dangerous, to notice a single detail \u2013 an orchid, say \u2013 and from this to extrapolate a 20-person luau. A while later, Stewart wrote about the party in Entertaining, her 1982 cookbook debut, lushly photographed and with step-by-step instructions for chicken wings with banana. \u201cThe pig wore a necklace of starfruit,\u201d she explained.

And then I came across a new skincare company aimed at four-year-olds. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://heyrini.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooUkJHuHTtmYx\">early days for Rini</a>, whose sole product is now a Korean-made hydrating facial mask. A healing ointment and daily barrier cream are allegedly in the works, too. If you were under any illusions as to the mask\u2019s purpose, it is infused with vitamin B12 \u2013 which, according to various skincare sites, improves elasticity and skin texture \u2013 with a clear peel-on application process modelled online, Patrick Bateman-style, by a preschooler.</p><p>On the one hand, I appreciate that children put all sorts on their faces \u2013 face paint, stickers, poo, toothpaste, kitchen cleaner, a sibling\u2019s blood, and that\u2019s just in this last week alone \u2013 and that their faces will occasionally need to be cleaned.

    "summary": "<p><strong>(Modern Love)</strong><br />The producer\u2019s second album is a granular dissection of <em>cumbia rebajada</em>, forcing the listener to focus on the strangeness of every moment in her ambient soundworld</p><p>Mexican-American producer Delia Beatriz, AKA Debit, has a talent for making historical sounds her own. Her 2022 breakthrough, The Long Count, featured woozy, ambient soundscapes made from electronically processed samples of ancient Maya flutes. On her latest record, Desaceleradas (Decelerated), Beatriz turns her attention to the 90s trend of <em>cumbia rebajada</em>. Slowing the Afro-Latin dance genre of <em>cumbia</em> to a sludgy tempo, <em>cumbia rebajada</em> is a dub-influenced take on a typically upbeat, party-driven sound. DJ Gabriel Due\u00f1ez popularised the style with his bootleg cassettes; two of his earliest releases now form the basis of Beatriz\u2019s experiments.</p><p>Landing somewhere between composer William Basinski\u2019s Disintegration Loops and DJ Screw\u2019s chopped\u2019n\u2019screwed production style, Desaceleradas slows the shaker-rattling, synth syncopations of <em>cumbia rebajada</em> into unrecognisable ambient territory. La Ronda y el Sonidero and Vinilos Trasnacionales contain hints of the signature <em>cumbia</em> shuffle and twanging synth melody, but Beatriz\u2019s added tape hiss, reverb and melodic warping transform the style into an eerie, ethereal soundworld of nightmare fairground music and yearning drones.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/debit-desaceleradas-review-afro-latin-club-sounds-slowed-to-a-seductive-crawl\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p><strong>(Mass Appeal)</strong><br />The first release since the death of their founding member dwells on the afterlife, yet doesn\u2019t forsake their perpetually sunny sound</p><p>Cabin in the Sky, the tenth album by De La Soul \u2013 and first since the 2023 death of founding member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/13/a-new-style-of-speak-the-lyrical-genius-of-trugoy-the-dove\">Trugoy the Dove</a>, AKA Dave Jolicoeur \u2013 is, loosely, a concept album about death and the afterlife. A spoken-word intro by actor Giancarlo Esposito primes you for something heavy, but you are instantly reminded, of course, that this is a De La Soul album: it seems practically impossible that their brand of lackadaisical, perpetually sunny plunderphonics could ever feel like a drag. The lush strings of Yuhdontstop introduce an album that\u2019s always projected in full-saturation Technicolor: from the effervescent Natalie Cole sample on Will Be to Maseo\u2019s jovial, avuncular ad-libs that open Cruel Summers Bring Fire Life!!, Cabin in the Sky feels warm and rich in vitamin D, a tonic for chillier months.</p><p>For the most part, the afterlife theme seems to have been tacked on, likely after Trugoy\u2019s death; the album still features his vocals, and most of the songs on the album fit squarely in De La Soul\u2019s already established surrealist world. (Patty Cake, a minimalist highlight, reinterprets classic schoolyard chants, a conceit that somehow hasn\u2019t already been done on a De La Soul record.) Even so, lasting more than 70 minutes, Cabin in the Sky can feel like a slog, with the end lacking the sprightliness of the album\u2019s first half. An exception is the title track, on which Maseo and Pos pay tribute to Trugoy and others they\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s pensive and world-weary, but never loses its sense of magic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/de-la-soul-cabin-in-the-sky-review-a-full-colour-celebration-of-trugoy-the-dove-that-never-feels-heavy\">Continue reading...</a>",

In 2015, Garden of Delete had an accompanying origin story about an adolescent humanoid alien called Ezra; 2018\u2019s Age Of imagined artificial intelligence attempting to recreate human culture after humans themselves had been rendered extinct. Lopatin also has an all-consuming obsession with nostalgia and forgotten pop cultural artefacts: he\u2019s made albums based around warped loops of 80s pop hits, preset sounds on obsolete synthesisers and recordings of US radio stations changing formats, discarding the musical genres in which they previously specialised in favour of the current vogue.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/20/oneohtrix-point-never-tranquilizer-review-uncanny-ambient-music-for-an-agitated-era\">Continue reading...</a>",

Living a middle-class existence in London, he is suddenly widowed; one of the movie\u2019s off-target qualities is its refusal to specify the cause of death or even show us clearly what his wife looked like, which in real life would be unbearably vivid facts. Sam Spruell has a quietly sympathetic role as Cumberbatch\u2019s brother.</p><p>Left to look after their two young boys, he succumbs to a kind of breakdown, and hallucinates a giant nightmarish crow, which after a while the boys can sense too. The crow is derisively voiced by David Thewlis, and resembles the Ted-Hughes-ish illustrations Cumberbatch was working on. It sneeringly, ruthlessly mocks and jeers at his \u201csad dad\u201d anguish; while everyone else is walking on eggshells around him, perhaps making things worse, the brutal crow jabs its beak into his psychic wound.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/20/the-thing-with-feathers-review-benedict-cumberbatch-max-porter-grief\">Continue reading...</a>",

I love the countryside but I, in my cold hard heart, am an urban creature, really.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/nov/19/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-how-to-do-the-country-look-without-being-a-flat-cap-cliche\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>Wojciech Has\u2019s slice of 1960s surrealism is set in 18th-century Spain, as an officer careens through farcical encounters and erotic episodes in a wild ride that could be a series of Monty Python sketches</p><p>This epic picaresque comedy from 1965 is a head-spinning period-costume adventure of 18th-century Spain from Polish film-maker Wojciech Has. It is a surrealist film whose surrealism resides not merely in the bizarre parched landscape of the Sierra Morena mountain range with its bleached skulls, hanged bandits, crows and mysterious inns in which seductive encounters are to be had, but also simply in the bewildering juxtaposition of individual tales and anecdotes, stories which grow out of each other. The surrealist effect (and the comedy) is in the jolt from one micro-narrative to the other, and the realisation that the overall story is thwarted and undermined.</p><p>The premise is that in the Spanish town of Saragossa during the Napoleonic wars, one officer tries to arrest another, who is apparently reading an old book \u2013 but is then distracted by the fact that this book is about his own grandfather, the nobleman Alfonse Van Worden. (Later we discover that the passages about this grandfather have been added by hand, in pen-and-ink, hence Saragossa Manuscript.) Then we flash back to this preening aristocrat-soldier himself, played by prominent Polish actor Zbigniew Cybulski.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/19/the-saragossa-manuscript-review-cult-polish-period-costume-comedy-is-outrageous-head-spinner\">Continue reading...</a>",

This loving doc asks why \u2013 but leaves some questions unanswered</p><p>This documentary is probably, as they say, one for the heads \u2013 for connoisseurs who appreciate a great musician who was never a star. But the flaw of this film, admirably detailed and celebratory though it is, lies for me in the fact that it never pauses to wonder why exactly he was never a star, and what that precisely means. Does star quality consist, in some mysterious way, in a lack of formal musicianship?</p><p>Nicky Hopkins was a superbly accomplished pianist who played on records by the Who, the Kinks, Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (plus solo albums by all four ex-Beatles) and many more. His brilliant work meant he was admired and even hero-worshipped by musicians and producers on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a classically trained Englishman (like Elton John at about the same time, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music) yet sounded as if he learned piano in the Mississippi Delta. And all this was while Hopkins was dealing with serious ill-health; he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/12/moment-that-changed-me-crohns-constant-pain-operation-restored-appetite-stoma\">Crohn\u2019s disease</a> and later issues with drink and drugs. The latter were at least partly due to a need to dull the pain, in order to keep up with tough recording and touring schedules; it all contributed to his heartbreakingly early death at the age of just 50.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/19/the-session-man-review-mick-jagger-joins-look-at-amazing-life-of-keyboards-ace-nicky-hopkins\">Continue reading...</a>",

It wittily fuses the real and the fictional into a trance-state \u2013 and that\u2019s the state that I\u2019ve sometimes found a little static in previous films by Lucile Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107, but not here. Dreamily strange it might be (and in fact, on the face of it, entirely preposterous) this movie had me gripped with its two outstanding lead performances \u2013 from Marion Cotillard and newcomer Clara Pacini \u2013 and a clamorous musical score.</p><p>Cotillard plays a diva-ish movie actor called Cristina, who is the lead in a new adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Snow Queen being filmed on a soundstage which is in a remote and snowy spot in late 60s France; she is gorgeously costumed in a sparkling white form-fitting gown and crown, a look she carries off with great unsmiling hauteur. Pacini plays Jeanne, a teenage girl in a foster home nearby, stricken with memories of the death of her mother, whose bead necklace she keeps. In her loneliness and grief, Jeanne has projected her feelings into an obsession with the story of the Snow Queen, an obsession further displaced at another remove into idolising the teen girls who ice-skate at the local rink. One day she runs away, stealing the ID of an older girl called Bianca and breaks into the film studio to sleep overnight; she somehow gets a job as an extra, astonished to realise what story is being filmed, and it is here that her gamine prettiness and air of demurely sensitive adoration for the queen catches Cristina\u2019s eye.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/16/the-ice-tower-review-marion-cotillard-focus-of-obsession-and-idolisation-in-death-wish-fairytale\">Continue reading...</a>",

This documentary narrated by Imelda Staunton tells the story of the campaign to hold the Irish government to account for its role in the laundries, mother and baby homes and industrial schools for children. A key figure in that campaign is Maeve O\u2019Rourke, an impressive young Irish human rights lawyer whose master\u2019s thesis at Harvard Law School served as a key legal submission in the legal fight for justice.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke had plans for a career in international human rights law until she watched a survivor speaking in a debate on Irish television. We see that footage here, of Michael O\u2019Brien, a former mayor and survivor of rape and torture by priests at a residential school, as he blasts a government minister, white-hot with fury, his trauma raw. It takes your breath away.

Pitting a grizzled prospector against an entire platoon of Nazis, writer-director Jalmari Helander heeded the lessons of George Miller\u2019s Mad Max: Fury Road, principally that there is serious cinematic value in going pedal-to-the-metal along a single, straight narrative line. That profitable sleeper hit now yields this choice follow-up, which somehow feels more expansive while still clocking in under 90 minutes.</p><p>Having seen off the SS, indomitable hero Aatami (Jorma Tommila) gains a tragic backstory and a new, vicious postwar foe in the tremendously named Red Army butcher Igor Draganov, played by wily James Cameron favourite Stephen Lang. Again, the economy of Helander\u2019s approach proves striking and thrilling. No unnecessary obstacles have been placed between the audience and a good time at the movies: we get one scene of Aatami dismantling his family home beam by beam and one scene of Draganov being sprung from jail before the pair intersect in the back roads of Soviet-occupied Finland. Cutting to the chase grants Helander time to craft set pieces in which Aatami outthinks and outflanks the Red Army\u2019s might; in this respect, Sisu 2 is a more-of-the-same sequel. The good news is that it remains terrific: punchy, old-school stunt work, crisply uncluttered cutting, and varied, inventive baddie-splattering from the moment Aatami deploys one of those beams to take down a jet fighter.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/19/sisu-road-to-revenge-review-finnish-hero-takes-on-a-red-army-butcher-in-terrific-sequel\">Continue reading...</a>",

But now the focus narrows to the main players and their explosive romantic crises, essentially through two interlocking love triangles: Glinda the Good, Elphaba the Wicked and the Wizard \u2013 and Glinda, Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, the handsome young military officer with whom both witches are not so secretly in love, as well as possibly having feelings for each other.</p><p>Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the Wizard, who pretty much becomes the Darth Vader of Oz: a slippery carnival huckster who is realising that his seedy charm is corroding his soul. Jonathan Bailey pivots to a much more serious, less campy, more passionate Prince and Ariana Grande is, as ever, delicate and doll-like as Glinda, though with less opportunity for comedy. But the superstar among equals is Cynthia Erivo, bringing her black-belt screen presence to the role of Elphaba, and revealing a new vulnerability and maturity. Elsewhere, Marissa Bode returns as Nessarose, Elphaba\u2019s wheelchair-using half-sister; Ethan Slater is Boq, the Munchkin working as her servant; and Michelle Yeoh brings stately sweetness to the role of the Wizard\u2019s private secretary Madame Morrible.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/18/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jeff-goldblum\">Continue reading...</a>",

When I hear a phrase in my head it is free of the confines of bar lines, but, in practical application, eventually it needs to get squeezed into recognisable shapes and containers. Every composer has their own strategy (some eschew bar lines entirely, or use alternative notational strategies outside the traditional western systems), but it\u2019s always a negotiation: does the way the composer notates the rhythm correspond to how it should best appear on the flute player\u2019s music stand?</p><p>I have distinct memories of being 13, hearing a piece (specifically, Stravinsky\u2019s Symphony in Three Movements), basically memorising it from the recording, and then being absolutely shocked when I finally saw the score. \u201cThat\u2019s where the downbeat is?!\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s sense of time and my understanding of the same were at variance in a way I still find exciting: the idea that there are infinite superimpositions of a practical system (notation) over a medium (sound) most often experienced by an audience without the score.

Nowadays you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the Nintendo Entertainment System was the only console available in the mid-to-late 1980s. If you were brought up in Nintendo\u2019s target markets of Japan and North America, this chunky contraption essentially <em>was</em> the only game in town \u2013 the company had Mario after all, and its vice-like hold on third-party developers created a monopoly for major titles of the era. But in Europe, where home computers ruled the era, the NES was beaten by a technologically superior rival.</p><p>The Sega Master System was originally released in Japan in the autumn of 1985 as the Sega Mark III. Based around the famed Z80 CPU (used in home computers such as the Spectrum, Amstrad and TRS-80) and a powerful Sega-designed video display processor, it boasted 8kb of RAM, a 64-colour palette and the ability to generate 32 sprites on screen at one time \u2013 making the NES (based on the older 6502 processor) look like an ancient relic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/18/sega-master-system-nintendo-entertainment-system\">Continue reading...</a>",

In one memorable shot straight from the Jilly Cooper precoital playbook, a pretty white bow is cut from Cathy\u2019s bodice using a labourer\u2019s knife, a moment of unforgivable hamminess were it not incredibly hot. Never mind that Emily Bront\u00eb rarely mentions bows in the book; that one is an entire plot device.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/nov/18/big-bows-style-trend-feminine-ironic-strangely-subversive\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "title": "\u2018I was born in a melting pot. Melting isn\u2019t fun\u2019: Jon M Chu on Wicked: For Good, Ariana Grande \u2013 and living the American dream",
    "summary": "<p>As his sequel to Wicked prepares to storm Christmas, the director talks about the dynamism of Grande and Cynthia Erivo  \u2013 and why his Wizard of Oz riff is quite simply one of the greatest stories of our time</p><p>Let\u2019s start with a quick recap on the first Wicked film. Its premise: what would the legend of Oz look like, told from the perspective of someone other than that cute but dozy blow-in, Dorothy? The wicked witch, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), is entirely green, and has therefore been ostracised since childhood. Glinda (Ariana Grande), the good witch, is everybody\u2019s princess but, after a time, the two become best friends. I\u2019ll skirt over how the Tin Man, the Lion and the Scarecrow come about, suffice to say that, in the film at least, their backstories make perfect and resonant sense (except for the Lion, but never mind). The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) is not a good guy \u2013 but is he a bad guy? The morals swirl, in an expertly handled way.</p><p>The first film left us at the point of discovery that Oz, far from being a magic paradise, was actually built on foundations of discrimination, oppression, enslavement and mendacity \u2013 or, if you like things simple, fascism. The fact that the slave-caste is the animal kingdom rather than a human out-group doesn\u2019t make this opulent fantasia feel any less pointedly topical. \u201cAny timeless story feels timely,\u201d director Jon M Chu says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about the human condition. When people become too powerful, what happens to the powerless? That cycle, unfortunately, challenges us every few generations, and maybe this is our moment. We\u2019re the adults in the room now.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/17/jon-m-chu-interview-director-wicked-for-good-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-wizard-of-oz\">Continue reading...</a>",

His perfectionism paid off; as the long queue of cars snaking up to the ticket office on a beautiful October morning attests, Chatsworth is one of the most popular stately homes in the UK today, welcoming more than 600,000 visitors a year.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/nov/13/chatsworth-house-derbyshire-new-family-friendly-hotel\">Continue reading...</a>",

The Hekes are a working-class Maori family in South Auckland: Temuera Morrison is the boozing, brawling, bragging alpha-male welfare claimant Jake, who comes home from drinking in the pub with his pathetic sycophant mates to terrorise and assault his wife Beth, played by Rena Owen, and their five children. He is entirely indifferent to the fate of his two elder sons who have drifted into gangland culture and crime, as well as his sensitive daughter Grace, who has talent as a writer. One son gets gang tattoos; the other is taken to a juvenile reformatory where he is at least tutored in the ways of Maori culture \u2013 the haka and the taiaha warrior spear \u2013 and learns dignity and self-respect. But back at Jake\u2019s chaotic house, Grace is raped by Jake\u2019s grotesque friend \u201cUncle Bully\u201d; disaster follows, and Beth passionately confronts the wretched Jake: \u201cOur people once were warriors, but unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit \u2026\u201d</p><p>Tamahori let rip with all this emotional violence, and landed sledgehammer punches with the pub scenes, the home scenes and the gang ritual initiation scenes, handling them with confidence and verve. He created a gutsy, heartfelt picture with a very 90s streak of brash and trash. It was a hit with audiences and critics, and \u2013 for good or ill \u2013 deeply impressed industry executives in Hollywood who could see how Tamahori could bring this energy and flair to mainstream genre material.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/07/lee-tamahori-once-were-warriors\">Continue reading...</a>",

She brought an authentic, undiluted American screen-acting flavour to everything she was in, and ran hugely successful movie and TV careers in parallel for decades, playing waitresses, neighbours, moms, sirens and daughters, and ranging from comedy to drama.</p><p>She was famously the mother of screen actor Laura Dern and wife of Bruce Dern, and repeatedly acted with Laura in a remarkable mother-daughter partnership in which the two women\u2019s closeness always shone through. You might compare it to Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli, or Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher \u2014 although Diane Ladd and Laura Dern were far more trouble-free and without that kind of angst. They were Oscar-nominated together for their joint appearance in Martha Coolidge\u2019s Depression drama Rambling Rose from 1991. And they also both appeared in David Lynch\u2019s Wild at Heart and Inland Empire, Alexander Payne\u2019s Citizen Ruth, and in Mike White\u2019s HBO drama Enlightened \u2013 and in three of these they played, naturally, a mother and daughter. In Joel Hershman\u2019s 1992 comedy Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Ladd acted alongside her own mother, the stage actor Mary Lanier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/04/diane-ladd-brought-real-star-power-to-sharp-and-subtle-supporting-roles\">Continue reading...</a>",

We don\u2019t expect our life to evolve without changing and we never know what\u2019s round the corner \u2013 why should music be any different?\u201d He further explained that each part of his drum kit he considered to be a musical being \u201cin its own right\u201d. He designed and tuned his cymbals to his own specification. Mix the sound of cymbals with the drums and then \u201cyou think harmonically on the kit,\u201d he added. The sounds inside DeJohnette\u2019s head could never be contained by the conventions of drum technique. He was also a pianist of considerable merit \u2013 who released a solo piano album, Return, in 2016 \u2013 and every facet of his musicianship seemed to be on display all of the time, until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/27/jack-dejohnette-versatile-jazz-drummer-miles-davis-fusion-dies-aged-83\">his death this week aged 83</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/27/jack-dejohnette-was-more-than-a-jazz-drummer-his-staggering-range-made-him-a-superhuman-force-in-music\">Continue reading...</a>",

The latter were caused by the duo\u2019s frontman, Marc Almond, clad in eyeliner and jewellery, delivering his vocal with a weird combination of intense passion, high camp and occasional knowing looks to camera: he was clearly a gay man, but a gay man who declined to conform to the pantomime stereotype that still prevailed on British TV, a decision that first upset his own record company boss \u2013 who collared Almond backstage and protested \u201cyou\u2019ve got to butch it up a bit!\u201d \u2013 then apparently caused the BBC\u2019s switchboards to light up.</p><p>Almond was such an arresting presence that it was easy to overlook the other guy on stage, moustachioed, mute and virtually motionless behind his keyboard.
