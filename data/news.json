Which makes Dove Ellis so thoroughly unusual, because so little is known about him.</p><p>His debut album arrives with no biography and barely any information at all apart from the track listing and a few minor details. He doesn\u2019t appear to have ever given an interview and in one song here scolds: \u201cKeep their cameras off my face.\u201d His publicist, whose job thus far seems solely to be sending out music, describes Ellis as a \u201can introverted character\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/04/dove-ellis-blizzard-review-irish-indie-enigmas-glorious-debut-justifies-the-buzz\">Continue reading...</a>",

It was a story as absurd as it was stressful, a chain of delis threatened me with legal action over the title of a book I had spent years creating.

Among the originators of the quintessentially 90s acid-jazz genre, Jamiroquai are now a legacy act worthy of their own themed dress-up. Tonight, sole founding member and noted headgear enthusiast Jay Kay (hat tally: four) draws from three decades of material, ranging from their 1993 debut Emergency on Planet Earth to new material set for release next year.</p><p>Because many of these songs rely on flashy production, their strongest elements often get lost when translated to a live setting. The sweeping strings of Little L get buried in the mix, as do the beats on disco-leaning tracks such as Canned Heat. Seven Days in Sunny June is a bit livelier, benefiting from loose arrangements and acoustic instrumentation. Early single Too Young to Die is a showcase for Jay Kay\u2019s impressive vocal range, still intact more than 30 years on.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/04/jamiroquai-review-jay-kay-ovo-hydro-glasgow\">Continue reading...</a>",

What\u2019s her secret? \u2018Be a looker-ahead\u2019</p><p>It is surely a comfort to anyone still awaiting mega-success to know that June Squibb was in her mid-80s before she hit the big time. Her role as a foul-mouthed matriarch in the 2013 film Nebraska brought her an Oscar nomination, and she had her first leading role in last year\u2019s action comedy, Thelma. Now she\u2019s playing the lead again, in the new film Eleanor the Great <em>and </em>she\u2019s currently in rehearsals for a show on Broadway. Is Squibb, who has just turned 96, sick of talking about her late-peaking success? \u201cI think people are interested, so no, it\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is funny, because when I first came to New York \u2013 it was the 50s \u2013 I did The Boy Friend, a musical, and I was a big hit.\u201d But it was theatre, she concedes. \u201cThe film thing is so different.\u201d</p><p>In Eleanor the Great, Scarlett Johansson\u2019s directorial debut, Squibb plays Eleanor Morgenstein, a 94-year-old woman who, mourning the loss of her best friend Bessie, moves from Florida to New York to be near her daughter. Encouraged to make new friends, Eleanor goes to the local Jewish community centre to join a choir, but the woman belting out Stephen Sondheim is enough to make anyone rush for the door. \u201cOh god,\u201d mutters Eleanor, backing away, before being scooped up by the Holocaust survivors group, meeting at the same time, who erroneously assume she\u2019s one of them. Lonely and grieving, US-born Eleanor finds herself passing off Bessie\u2019s survival story as her own.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/03/june-squibb-interview-eleanor-the-great-scarlett-johansson-broadway-gypsy\">Continue reading...</a>",

Whether you prefer green or smoked, free-range or organic, the humble ham is a cornerstone of the festive feast.

This is an alternate universe in which it is perfectly acceptable to have Michael Bubl\u00e9 on your Spotify playlist and to drink at lunchtime (to be fair, it&nbsp;is almost dark by then) and non-negotiable to play parlour games.</p><p>Christmas also comes with its own set of fashion rules, some of which are set in stone, and others which are updated every year. So I thought it may be helpful to have a quick refresher on how to dress for Christmas. Not least because one of the ways in which this time of year is its own little world is that even people who don\u2019t like parties go to parties.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/03/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-tis-the-season-to-party-time-to-recap-christmas-dressing-rules\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p><strong>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; Eyes Out/Blumhouse Games<br /></strong>Psychedelic visuals and a promising premise are let down by tired game design in this first-person horror with an appearance from the synthpop pioneer</p><p>Video games have delivered a feast of singular and wondrous sights in 2025: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/27/monster-hunter-wilds-review-prepare-for-the-most-epic-fight-of-your-life\">ecological fantasias</a> teeming with magical beasts; stunning, historically obsessive recreations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/mar/19/pushing-buttons-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft\">feudal Japan</a>. But here is an end-of-year curio: psychological horror game Sleep Awake serves us synth-rock pioneer Gary Numan stepping into what is perhaps the schlockiest role of his life \u2013 a gigantic floating head named Hypnos.</p><p>This late-stage cameo is not quite indicative of the game as a whole; the handful of hours prior to Numan\u2019s arrival are more mournful than madcap. Mostly, you explore the dilapidated, tumbledown streets of what is thought to be the last city on Earth. This setting is a magnificent work of imagination. You see it through the eyes of a young woman named Katja, who moves along rooftops, gazing out upon a barren, lifeless hinterland, into labyrinthine streets whose darkness and arcane logic recall the stirring subterranean etchings of Italian artist Piranesi.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/03/sleep-awake-review-gary-numan-cameos-in-an-overly-straightforward-sleep-deprivation-horror\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>Gloria Swanson is extraordinary as faded film-star Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder\u2019s cameo-packed self-referential masterpiece about tinseltown ghosts and delusions</p><p></p><p></p><p>Billy Wilder\u2019s film starring Gloria Swanson as a reclusive former silent movie star, and William Holden as a young wannabe writer who becomes her kept man, more than ever looks not merely like tinseltown satire or LA noir, but a ghost story. It\u2019s the ultimate film about how the screenwriter is always the loser and the chump. You can tell that Norma Desmond (Swanson) is washed up because she has actually written a screenplay \u2013 which is, however, more than Joe (Holden) ever achieves in the course of this film.</p><p>Sunset Boulevard\u2019s own script, co-written by Wilder with Charles Brackett and DM Marshman Jr, is of course superb. And after 75 years, we can appreciate the movie\u2019s sober judgment about the dangers of cinephilia and Hollywood ancestor worship. The street name itself, with its dying fall, is an occult omen of the eerie and macabre things that happen here. David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive had the same chill. The street name is about the final ending, and this is one of the very few films of any sort with a really satisfying ending: the way in which the delusional old celebrity, her eyes pinwheeling, is finally induced to come placidly down the stairs to surrender to the authorities. She grimaces and gurns directly into the lens at the very last, rather like Anthony Perkins in Psycho \u2013 a film that incidentally was very much influenced by this one.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/03/sunset-boulevard-review-billy-wilder-gloria-swanson-norma-desmond\">Continue reading...</a>",

This documentary watches him at work: dogged, nonconformist and combative</p><p>Renowned investigative journalist Seymour Hersh was never played in a film by Robert Redford or Dustin Hoffman, like the Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. But as this documentary portrait argues, he\u2019s probably more important than either. Hersh has a longer record of breaking big stories, from the My Lai massacre in Vietnam to torture by US army personnel at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq \u2013 the latter a historic scoop underscored by the stomach-turning photos which Hersh brought to light. Hersh is asked if Abu Ghraib would have been the story it was without those pictures and replies: \u201cNo pictures, no story.\u201d Well, maybe. But his other scoops had no pictures of this kind. One incidental thing Abu Ghraib showed was how ubiquitous digital photography became at the beginning of the century; how easy it was to take and share photos. Now, in the new era of AI, photos are ceasing to be the smoking gun of truth.</p><p>The title of this movie speaks for itself. Hersh is always on the hunt for things that powerful people would prefer to stay hidden \u2013 although a paradox of the film is that Hersh has to protect his sources, cover them up as it were. Secrecy plays a part in his own professional life, and when it appears as if film-makers Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus have sensitive names in the notes that he has turned over to them, Hersh becomes agitated and appears ready to back out of the documentary entirely.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/03/cover-up-review-documentary-seymour-hersh-journalist\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p><strong>3 December 1925</strong>: There has been a revival in the practice of indulging in mud baths as an aid to beauty and as a curative treatment for various ailments </p><p>There has recently been a marked revival in the practice of indulging in mud baths as an aid to beauty and as a curative treatment for various ailments. Mud baths are specially effective for rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, and gout, and even where a person does not suffer from any of these troubles the mud bath has its advantages, for there is nothing like it for ensuring clearness of the skin and giving a general tonic to the whole body. It is becoming increasingly popular with women who are interested in the most effective beauty culture. The mud bath of the beauty experts is really a peat bath. Much of the peat used comes from the area around Goole in Yorkshire, and many tons are dispatched weekly to the centres where such baths are provided.</p><p>The taking of a mud bath is an acquired art. To attempt to jump in as one does sometimes when entering an ordinary swimming bath would be as foolish as to try and dive in. The bather steps gently into the peat mixture and forces the body into the mud until only the head stands clear. There he or she must remain for 20 minutes. Contrary to expectations the mud bath is not unpleasant. The muddy mixture gives a warm sensation. After 20 minutes immersion the bather scrambles out leaving as much of the mud as possible in the bath, and proceeds to a warm shower, which soon clears off the remainder of the peaty paste. Then, wrapped in heated towels, the body all aglow with reinvigorated life, the bather rests upon a couch.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/03/mud-baths-the-new-beauty-culture-archive-1925\">Continue reading...</a>",

In addition to the movement and exercise approaches you highlighted, a wide range of strategies for supporting healthy fascia is being researched by the Fascia Research Group at Ulm University in Germany, led by Prof Robert Schleip. Fascia research is still in its infancy, but the implications for healthcare are considerable. As early as 2015, a conference at Harvard Medical School examined links between fascia, acupuncture and oncology; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkMVPd994Kg\">lectures</a> remain available online and underline how much more we need to understand about fascia\u2019s role in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPCuHQ9Vbw4\">medicine</a>.</p><p>Manual therapists have long recognised the importance of working with fascia. Andrew Taylor Still, the founder of osteopathy, stressed its significance, and newer approaches such as the Bowen technique aim to improve hydration, proprioception and flexibility by engaging fascia gently but directly. One of the least appreciated aspects of fascia is its extraordinary sensitivity: it provides a constant <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11346343/\">feedback loop to the central and autonomic nervous systems</a>, responding continuously to internal and external stimuli.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/02/understanding-the-role-of-fascia-in-keeping-the-body-healthy\">Continue reading...</a>",

A feast is about togetherness, whether there are two people at the table, or 16. The primal joy of good food taps into something even more fundamental than hunger; if food is a love language, a feast is a big hug.</p><p>Is it sacrilege to say that being a host matters more than being a cook? Not to disparage the skill of the chef. Quite the opposite, it takes skill to make really good gravy, concentration to remember to take the cake out of the oven before it burns, and years of experience to time a roast to come together at the right moment.

Many expected it to play a huge part in the awards conversation, with key scenes surely destined to be shown in sizzle reel clips at endless prize ceremonies and invoked in endless op-ed pieces about fragile masculinity. But no. Now it is almost a modern film <em>maudit</em>, all but forgotten, a cursed film only now coming out quietly, and maybe its star is <em>maudit</em> as well.</p><p>Majors plays Killian Maddox, an iron-pumping wannabe caring for his disabled grandfather and cultivating a fan obsession with the stars of the bodybuilding circuit. He is particularly keen on a preening beefcake named Brad Vanderhorn, whose magazine covers Killian plasters over the walls of his sad bedroom, and dreams of making it on to these covers himself. Killian is plagued with loneliness, depression and incipient mental illness, body dysmorphia and inability to connect with women. At one point he has a full-tilt, Travis Bickle-style disastrous date with Jessie (Haley Bennett), a co-worker at the supermarket where he has a day-job. And he is addicted to steroids, which trigger terrifying \u2019roid rage.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/02/magazine-dreams-review-powerful-bodybuilding-drama-dogged-by-star-jonathan-majors-assault-conviction\">Continue reading...</a>",

Many people mistakenly think radiator heat is similar to sunlight \u2013 warm and life-giving \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. Sunlight provides energy for photosynthesis, while radiator heat is dry, stagnant and relentless, closer to a slow cooker than sunshine.</p><p><strong>The </strong><strong>hack</strong><br />\n Before turning on the heating, give your plants a seasonal reset. Move them away from radiators or vents (at&nbsp;least half a metre, ideally). Group plants together to create a pocket of humidity, or place a bowl of water nearby to counteract dryness. Top-dress tired soil with fresh compost, trim off any yellowing leaves and wipe dust from the foliage so the plants can breathe.

My favourite Christmas songs are <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HTCFi4l3nkY\">Eartha Kitt\u2019s sultry version of Santa Baby</a>, because it gets all the adults in the mood to get up and have a boogie with Santa, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, because the lyrics are so pure. No Christmas songs drive me mad. It\u2019s Christmas: they\u2019re all great. <em><a href=\"https://www.envisagepromotions.co.uk/santa-performers/\">Paul Fessi</a></em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/02/professional-santa-on-their-most-loved-and-hated-christmas-hits\">Continue reading...</a>",

And yet thanks to subtle, considered performances, a finely milled script, inventive craftsmanship and a deep sense of empathy for the precarious lives of refugees, it packs a considerable wallop.</p><p>The story starts with reticent, clearly traumatised Nigerian Isio, played by Ronke Adekoluejo, who is subtle throughout in a role that could easily have been done with too broad a brush. Isio arrives at a women\u2019s shelter for asylum seekers in the UK where she is assigned to share a room with Farah (a luminous Ann Akinjirin), who is already a few steps ahead of Isio in the legal process that permits applicants to appeal twice. (If the second appeal isn\u2019t approved, applicants are immediately deported.) Although Isio is a bit standoffish at first, gentle Farah shows her roommate the ropes, warning her not to trust the guards, to watch out for the tough women dealing drugs in the yard, and to try not to lose hope.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/02/dreamers-review-refugee-drama-joy-gharoro-akpojotor\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>Following every dizzying spin of Chalamet\u2019s table tennis hustler, Josh Safdie\u2019s whip-crack comedy serves sensational shots \u2013 and a smart return by Gwyneth Paltrow</p><p>This new film from Josh Safdie has the fanatical energy of a 149-minute ping pong rally carried out by a single player running round and round the table. It\u2019s a marathon sprint of gonzo calamities and uproar, a sociopath-screwball nightmare like something by Mel Brooks \u2013 only in place of gags, there are detonations of bad taste, cinephile allusions, alpha cameos, frantic deal-making, racism and antisemitism, sentimental yearning and erotic adventures. It\u2019s a farcical race against time where no one needs to eat or sleep.</p><p>Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a spindly motormouth with the glasses of an intellectual, the moustache of a movie star and the physique of a tiny cartoon character (though that could just be the initials). He\u2019s loosely inspired by Marty \u201cThe Needle\u201d Reisman, a real-life US table tennis champ from the 1950s who was given to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/06/wimbledon2003.tennis8\">Bobby Riggs-type shenanigans</a>: betting, hustling and showmanship stunts. The movie probably earns the price of admission simply with one gasp-inducing setpiece involving whippet-thin Chalamet, a dog, a bathtub, cult director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/im-not-a-saint-abel-ferrara-on-his-wild-career-rehab-and-nightclubbing-with-donald-trump\">Abel Ferrara</a> in a walk-on role and a scuzzy New York hotel room. Talk about not being on firm ground. Similarly disorientating is the climactic revelation of Chalamet\u2019s naked buttocks prior to one of the most upsetting displays of corporal punishment since Lindsay Anderson\u2019s If\u2026.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/01/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-ping-pong-table-tennis\">Continue reading...</a>",

Winter works primarily in contrasts: poppy instrumentation with off-kilter song structures; lyrics that are abstract yet never impenetrable; boyish charm wrapped in the confidence expected from a singer-songwriter twice his age.</p><p>In this intimate show, Winter hunches over his piano, whittling away at songs as if the audience are peering through the window of his private rehearsal space. It would be the more conventional choice for him to tour with a band, especially after the one-two punch of his solo debut album Heavy Metal late last year and his band Geese\u2019s Getting Killed in September. But Winter doesn\u2019t do things simply: every song tonight gets a new arrangement. He tickles and pummels reverb-soaked keys in ways that transform and reconstruct Heavy Metal\u2019s foundations into something more alive than the recording.

    "summary": "<p>Through static compositions and observational detail, the documentary explores how Laos\u2019s visitors and residents inhabit the same spaces in very different ways</p><p>Shot in Laos, Kimi Takesue\u2019s idiosyncratic documentary gazes upon sights and vistas that would not be out of place on travel postcards. Minimal in its camera movements, the film looks at glimmering golden temples, waterfalls cascading down silver rocks, and processions of monks moving through lush landscapes. It also shows what is absent from glossy brochures, namely the intrusion of tourists. The disruption to the local rhythm of life is at once visual and aural: we see throngs of wandering visitors, their casual clothes of shorts and T-shirts a stark contrast to the ancient architecture. Their occasionally rowdy leisure activities are intercut with more mundane moments from the locals\u2019 everyday lives, like schoolchildren heading to class or laywomen offering alms to monks by the roadside.</p><p>There\u2019s a sense of tension between the static camera and the movements that occur within the frame. Scenes of tourists being loaded on to buses bring to mind Jacques Tati\u2019s 1967 classic Playtime, which gently pokes fun at the idea of an authentic cultural experience attained via consumerist means. The point of view in Takesue\u2019s film, however, is on shakier grounds. Some of the visual juxtapositions veer towards reiterating well-worn binaries between the east and west, the regional and the global. For instance, most of the tourists seen in Onlookers are white; in truth, visitors to Laos largely come from neighbouring Asian countries. Likewise, the Laotian population is also far from homogeneous: one sequence shows middle-aged men playing a game of catch, with the caption telling us they are \u201carguing in Lao\u201d \u2013 yet some of them are speaking Vietnamese.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/01/onlookers-review-snapshots-of-a-south-east-asian-country-shaped-by-tourism\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>She made a short, and much-ridiculed, trip to space. She tried to buy a house and fell foul of public opinion. And she\u2019s found love, apparently, with Justin Trudeau. Time to get up to speed before this singer next hits the headlines</p><p>Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? No? Just Katy Perry then. Seven months since her sense-defying jaunt into space, life on planet Earth hasn\u2019t let up for the embattled hitmaker. She\u2019s back in the headlines this week, implied to be raiding the pockets of a \u201cdisabled veteran\u201d while facing scrutiny for her somewhat inexplicable new romance with Justin Trudeau. Yes, that Justin Trudeau. Shall we?</p><p>1. <strong>Perry wins in court, but loses online<br /></strong>By one metric, such as \u201crelative to the rest of 2025\u201d, this might have been a good week for Katy Perry. Since 2020, she has been embroiled in a legal battle against Carl Westcott, who sold her an eight-bedroom, 11-bathroom mansion in Montecito for $15m. Westcott then attempted to renege on the deal, claiming to have been incapacitated by painkillers (prescribed after a back operation) when signing the paperwork. A judge ruled in Perry\u2019s favour in May last year, finding that Westcott was sound of mind when the sale went through. This week, another judge ruled that Perry was owed $1.8m in damages. This sounds like a win, you might think \u2013 <em>except</em> Perry had pushed for Westcott to pay $4.7m, <em>and</em> it\u2019s been widely written up as Perry money-grubbing from an <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15326915/katy-perry-lawsuit-veteran-montecito.html\">\u201c85-year-old disabled veteran\u201d</a>.

But the insistent framing may say more about Perry\u2019s unenviable position as pop culture\u2019s preferred punching bag.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/29/celebrity-crib-sheet-katy-perry-blue-origin-space-flight-justin-trudeau\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "title": "The Durutti Column: The Return of the Durutti Column review \u2013 fragile classic that echoes far beyond its time",
    "summary": "<p><strong>(London)</strong><br />The delicate experimentation of the band\u2019s debut may not have chimed with the post-punk 1980s, but its durability makes this deluxe reissue thoroughly deserved</p><p>The Durutti Column\u2019s debut album does not have an auspicious origin story. The band whose name it bore had split acrimoniously just before they were supposed to record it. Their guitarist Vini Reilly was so poleaxed by depression that he was virtually unable to leave his house: 12 different attempts were made to section him over the course of 1979. Believing that Reilly was \u201cgoing to die\u201d, Factory Records boss Tony Wilson intervened, buying him a new guitar, then suggested he visit a studio with the label\u2019s troubled but visionary producer Martin Hannett as \u201can experiment\u201d. The sessions were a disaster. Hannett ignored Reilly in favour of tinkering with a vast amount of cutting-edge electronic equipment he had brought with him. Reilly fitfully played something on the guitar, but eventually stormed out with the words: \u201cI\u2019m fucking sick of this.\u201d He did not return.</p><p>Unaware that he was making an album, Reilly was \u201cmortified\u201d when Hannett handed over a finished product, and \u201cabsolutely hated\u201d what he heard. The solitary upside, as he saw it, was his sense that it would never find a wider audience. The music on 1980\u2019s The Return of the Durutti Column bore no relation to the workmanlike post-punk that the original band had contributed to the label\u2019s compilation EP A Factory Sample, put together the previous year. (Although Reilly thought they were \u201ccomplete and total rubbish\u201d, too.) Grasping for comparisons, the music press likened it to the atmospheric jazz of the German label ECM and Reilly\u2019s guitar playing to that of Mike Oldfield and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/15/the-night-i-got-high-with-jerry-garcia\">Grateful Dead\u2019s Jerry Garcia</a> \u2013 neither of them having much musical cachet in the post-punk world of 1980. Even a positive review in the NME suggested listeners would consider The Return of the Durutti Column \u201chippy noodling\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/27/the-durutti-column-the-return-of-the-durutti-column-review\">Continue reading...</a>",

It was also reassuring to learn that in an area swept by forest fires in September, species such as strawberry trees (which are fire-resistant thanks to their low resin content) were beginning to bounce back \u2013 alongside highly flammable eucalyptus, which hinders other fire-retardant trees such as oak. Volunteers were being recruited to help with rewilding.</p><p>Visitor numbers to the Algarve are growing, with 2024 showing an increase of 2.6% on the previous year \u2013 but most arrivals head straight for the beach, despite there being so much more to explore. The shoreline is certainly wild and dramatic but the region is also keen to highlight the appeal of its inland areas. With the development of year-round hiking and cycling trails, plus the introduction of nature festivals, attention is being drawn to these equally compelling landscapes, featuring mountains and dense woodlands. The <a href=\"https://www.algarvewalkingseason.com/home-en\">Algarve Walking Season</a> (AWS) runs a series of five walking festivals with loose themes such as \u201cwater\u201d and \u201carchaeology\u201d between November and April. It\u2019s hoped they will inspire visitors year round, boosting the local economy and helping stem the tide of younger generations leaving in search of work.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/nov/27/authentic-algarve-exploring-portugal-beyond-the-beach\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>These iced Danish pastries stuffed with nuts and jam are a speciality of Tim\u2019s hometown of Racine, Wisconsin </p><p>Kringles are a kind of pastry that\u2019s synonymous with my home town of Racine, Wisconsin. Originally introduced by Danish immigrants in the late 19th century, they\u2019re essentially a big ring of flaky Viennese pastry filled with fruit or nuts, then iced and served in little slices. Even bad kringles are pretty delicious, and when out-of-towners try them for the first time, their reaction is usually: \u201dWhere has this been all my life?\u201d</p><p>We eat kringles year-round, but I mainly associate them with fall, perhaps because of their common autumnal fillings such as apple or cranberry, or perhaps because of the sense of <em>hygge</em> they provide. I also associate kringles with Thanksgiving \u2013 and with uncles. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me; Racine\u2019s biggest kringle baker, <a href=\"https://www.ohdanishbakery.com/\">O&amp;H Danish Bakery</a>, operates a cafe/shop called \u201cDanish Uncle\u201d. But I also think of Thanksgiving as the most uncle-y American holiday, geared towards watching football and snoozing on the couch.</p><p>Tim Anderson is the author of the 24 Hour Pancake People newsletter and Hokkaido: Recipes from the Seas, Fields and Farmlands of Northern Japan, published by Hardie Grant at \u00a328.

The Xbox 360 arrived on 22 November 2005 in the US and 2 December in the UK, about three months after I got my first job as a junior staff writer on GamesTM magazine. My memories of the night are hazy because a) it was a worryingly long time ago and b) there was a free bar, but I do remember that DJ Yoda played to a tragically deserted dancefloor, and everything was very green. My memories of the console itself, however, and the games I played on it, are still as clear as an <a href=\"https://consolevariations.com/collectibles/microsoft-xbox-crystal-console\">Xbox Crystal</a>. It is up there with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jul/16/the-25-greatest-video-game-consoles-ranked\">the greatest consoles</a> ever.</p><p>In 2001, the first Xbox had muscled in on a scene dominated by <a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/xbox-in-japan-the-battle-to-win-the-console-race-in-microsofts-toughest-market/\">Japanese consoles</a>, upsetting the established order (it outsold Nintendo\u2019s GameCube by a couple of million) and dragging console gaming into the online era with Xbox Live, an online multiplayer service that was leagues ahead of what the PlayStation 2 was doing. Nonetheless, the PS2 ended up selling over 150m to the original Xbox\u2019s 25m. The Xbox 360, on the other hand, would sell over 80m, neck and neck with the PlayStation 3 for most of its eight-year life cycle (and well ahead in the US). It turned Xbox from an upstart into a market leader.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/26/how-the-xbox-360-almost-won-the-console-war\">Continue reading...</a>",

The three accompanying albums (the first time the Beatles had allowed outtakes from their recording sessions to be officially released) sold in their millions. Its success helped kickstart the latterday Beatles industry, a steady stream of officially sanctioned documentaries, reissues, remixes, compilations and expanded editions, predicated on two ideas: that the Beatles\u2019 archive contains fathomless bounty; and that the band\u2019s story is so rich there\u2019s no limit to the number of times it can fruitfully be retold in fresh light.</p><p>For a while, those ideas seemed to hold true, but recently, it\u2019s been hard not to think the Beatles\u2019 Apple Corps might be trying to feed an insatiable appetite for content from an increasingly bare cupboard.

    "summary": "<p>A game cast and some decent twists help to elevate this passably entertaining London-set Christmas offering about a department store robbery</p><p>We\u2019re a few weeks into the annual Netflix Christmas dump and standards have already fallen below freezing. In both Alicia Silverstone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/12/a-merry-little-ex-mas-netflix-movie-review\">A Merry Little Ex-Mas</a> and Minka Kelly\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/19/champagne-problems-review-netflix-christmas-romcom\">Champagne Problems</a>, motions were lethargically, and cheaply, gone through without any seasonal sparkle added, a low bar once again set for the next month and change.</p><p>So while there\u2019s nothing all that remarkable about the streamer\u2019s latest festive effort, crime caper turned romcom Jingle Bell Heist, there\u2019s just about enough to give it an edge over its more anemic peers. Rather than being set in Snowflakeville or some other absurdly named small town in Middle America (while clearly being filmed in Canada), it\u2019s shot on location in London during Christmas 2023 (directed by Mike Flanagan\u2019s long-time cinematographer Michael Fimognari). The city does a great deal of heavy-lifting with every pub, caff and high street helping to conjure up a real sense of place usually absent in such territory (it also means no need for increasingly distracting fake CG snow). There are roles for British comedy stars like Peter Serafinowicz and Amandaland\u2019s wonderful Lucy Punch and the soundtrack opts for alternative holiday songs from Low and Run-DMC over yet another easily affordable cover of All I Want for Christmas Is You. There\u2019s also a plot that isn\u2019t quite as rote as we\u2019re used to with no career-minded woman waiting to be tamed by a family-craving hunk. These might not sound like major, applause-worthy diversions but in the hopelessly generic, and at times unforgivably lazy, world of Netflix Christmas fodder, it\u2019s not nothing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/26/jingle-bell-heist-review-netflix-comedy\">Continue reading...</a>",

For once there are no other boarders to dodge, no surfers whisking past: it\u2019s exhilarating, extraordinary and \u2026 really rather cold.</p><p>Croyde has long been a family favourite, but visiting in November does feel a bit of a gamble.

    "summary": "<p>Fans and historians have spent 60 years debating what the band means \u2013 and which member is greatest. Will the returning Anthology project and Sam Mendes\u2019s planned biopics create new arguments?</p><p>The early notion of the Beatles as \u201cfour lads that shook the world\u201d has been subject to many shifts in emphasis over the decades. They have been valorised, vilified, mythologised, misunderstood and even ignored. The release this month of the new Beatles Anthology \u2013 an expansion of the original mid-1990s compilation with CD, vinyl reissues and the documentary series streaming on Disney+ \u2013 is testament not just to their enduring appeal but also to how the constant reframing of their story reveals as much about our changing tastes. The 2025 edition arrives as a full-scale revisitation of the original project, bringing with it a remastered, expanded documentary series and a substantial reissue campaign.</p><p>What is more likely to reshape the way we see the band, though, is the addition of a brand-new ninth episode to the original TV series, built from recently excavated footage of Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr working together in 1994\u201395. Far more intimate and informal than the original broadcast, this material captures the three surviving Beatles rehearsing, reflecting and simply spending time as old friends rather than cultural monuments, albeit still with the \u201ckid brother\u201d tensions between Harrison and McCartney. They work on Free As a Bird and Now and Then, jokingly speculate on a stadium reunion tour and generally talk about their history, loss and their unfinished musical ideas. It\u2019s a rare, humanising coda to the well-worn story. With new material like this, and with more than that axiomatic 50 years of distance since the Beatles dissolved in a blizzard of lawsuits and \u201cfunny paper\u201d, are we finally approaching a unified theory of everything fab?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/25/the-beatles-anthology-stuart-maconie-historiography\">Continue reading...</a>",

The world\u2019s black rhino population has plummeted to just over 6,000 as rhinos are pushed to the brink of extinction by habitat loss and poaching. But conservation efforts have resulted in a rhino comeback in Kenya, where numbers are growing in fenced-off sanctuaries known as conservancies that employ local people and keep poachers out.</p><p>Tom Hardy provides a slightly distracting narration to this documentary, channelling David Attenborough with a dash of 19th-century aristo-explorer. The film opens with the fact that in the past three years, 1,900 rhinos have been poached across Africa, but not a single one in Kenya. In the Borana Conservancy we meet charismatic head ranger Ramson Kiloku, a man who knows every single rhino on his patch by its footprint and the nicks on its ears.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/25/rhino-review-tom-hardy-channels-david-attenborough-in-mission-to-save-kenyas-rhinos\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>At Maple Farm, nature is returning in droves: nightingales, grass snakes, slowworms, bats and insects. All due to the vision of a group determined to accelerate its recovery</p><p>The manically melodic song of the nightingale is a rare sound in Britain these days, but not at Maple Farm. Four years ago, a single bird could be heard at this secluded spot in rural Surrey; this summer, they were everywhere. \u201cWe were hearing them calling all night, from five different territories,\u201d says Meg Cookson, lead ecologist for the <a href=\"https://www.youngwilders.org/\">Youngwilders</a>, pointing to the woodland around us. A group of Youngwilders were camping out at the site, but the birds were so loud, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t sleep all night,\u201d says Layla Mapemba, the group\u2019s engagement lead. \u201cWe were all knackered the next day, but it was so cool.\u201d An expert from the Surrey Wildlife Trust came to help them net and ring one of the nightingales the next morning, Cookson recalls: \u201cHe\u2019d never held a nightingale in his hands before. He was crying.\u201d</p><p>Rewilding is by definition a slow business, but here at Maple Farm, after just four years, the results are already visible, and audible. The farm used to be a retirement home for horses. Now it\u2019s a showpiece for the Youngwilders\u2019 mission: to accelerate nature recovery, in one of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/58863097\">most nature-depleted countries in the world</a>, and to connect young people (18-30-year-olds) with a natural world they are often excluded from, and a climate crisis they are often powerless to prevent. Global heating continues, deforestation destroys natural habitats, and another Cop summit draws to a disappointing conclusion in Brazil \u2013 so who could blame young people for wanting to take matters into their own hands?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/25/it-fully-changed-my-life-how-young-rewilders-transformed-a-farm-and-began-a-movement\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p><strong>OVO Hydro, Glasgow<br /></strong>Noah Sebastian\u2019s vocals switch deftly from croon to scream to whisper, but the genre-hopping US metalcore band lack chemistry on the big stage</p><p></p><p>Melodic metalcore band Bad Omens are pulling out all the stops for their first UK arena headline tour. In the first five minutes, we\u2019ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bring-me-the-horizon\">Bring Me the Horizon</a>, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.</p><p>Although tonight\u2019s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band\u2019s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum\u2019n\u2019bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian\u2019s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band\u2019s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&amp;B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/bad-omens-review-ovo-hydro-glasgow\">Continue reading...</a>",

Anyone who\u2019s been listening to the music for at least that long can list myriad reasons why that\u2019s now the case: all the beats sound the same, all the artists are industry plants, all the lyrics are barely intelligible etc<em>. </em>For hip-hop forefather Abiodun Oyewole, though, it boils down to this: \u201cWe embraced \u2018party and bullshit\u2019, my brother.\u201d</p><p>Fifty-seven years ago, on what would have been Malcolm X\u2019s 43rd birthday, Oyewole cliqued up with two young poets at a writers\u2019 workshop in East Harlem\u2019s Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) to form what would become the Last Poets, a collective of bard revolutionaries. They outfitted themselves in African prints, performed over the beat of a congo drum and advocated for populism in their verses.

Notably, Oyewole could not contribute to that album because he had been incarcerated for an attempted robbery of a Ku Klux Klan headquarters, serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence.

But with this independence came fresh conflicts, as the new Panamanian government refused to recognise Tulenega Shire, an autonomous Indigenous territory formed in 1870. The Guna people were subjugated under racist laws designed to erase their culture and pillage their land of resources. In February 1925, the local population, women included, took up arms in what is known as the San Blas rebellion against Panama\u2019s soldiers, a courageous fight that brought about independence for the region.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/bila-burba-review-panama-guna-people-battle-revolutionary-battles\">Continue reading...</a>",

In Vienna, the Jewish Knoller family must make some hard choices. While one brother is sent to stay in America, younger sibling Freddie (Lucas Lynggaard T\u00f8nnesen) must fend for himself as his parents opt to stay behind \u2013 a choice that is clearly not going to end well. While the film cuts back and forth between periods, we see Freddie on a death march with other Jewish prisoners in one timeframe, and trying to make his way to the UK via France in another.</p><p>In the westward-bound section, Freddie ends up in Paris, broke and desperate but eager for a bit of glamour all the same. An encounter with raffish but slippery Christos (Fernando Guallar), another immigrant, results in Freddie securing a job in the Op\u00e9ra neighbourhood persuading Nazi soldiers with his perfect fluent German to come to a nightclub he and Christos work for. This is how he hopes to raise enough money to pay for forged papers. What follows tracks closely to dozens of similar stories about Jews in exile in Europe during the second world war, compelled to keep their identities secret, and while the film is in fact based on the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/genocide-survivors-cambodia-rwanda-holocaust-memorial-day\">a real-life Freddie Knoller,</a> the cliched treatment rather drains it of the plausibility it needs to make it distinctive.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/desperate-journey-review-annabel-jankel\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>Our muscles, bones and organs are held together by a network of tissue that influences our every move. Is there a way we can use it to our advantage?</p><p>Fascia, the connective tissue that holds together the body\u2019s internal structure, really hasn\u2019t spent all that long in the limelight. Anatomists have known about its existence since before the Hippocratic oath was a thing, but until the 1980s it was routinely tossed in the bin during human dissections, regarded as little more than the wrapping that gets in the way of studying everything else. Over the past few decades, though, our understanding of it has evolved and (arguably) overshot \u2013 now, there are plenty of personal trainers who will insist that you should be loosening it up with a foam roller, or even harnessing its magical elastic powers to jump higher and do more press-ups. But what\u2019s it <em>really</em> doing \u2013 and is there a way you can actually take advantage of it?</p><p>\u201cThe easiest way to describe fascia is to think about the structure of a tangerine,\u201d says Natasha Kilian, a specialist in musculoskeletal physiotherapy at Pure Sports Medicine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the outer skin, and beneath that, the white pith that separates the segments and holds them together. Fascia works in a similar way: it\u2019s a continuous, all-encompassing network that wraps around and connects everything in the body, from muscles and nerves to blood vessels and organs. It\u2019s essentially the body\u2019s internal wetsuit, keeping everything supported and integrated.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever carved a joint of meat, it\u2019s the thin, silvery layer wrapped around the muscle, like clingfilm.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/24/secrets-of-the-body-what-is-fascia-health-foam-roller\">Continue reading...</a>",

This weekend, the Guardian launched the results of its year-long investigation into radical free birthing, and the US-based Free Birth Society (FBS). Our reporting reveals how influencers made millions by pushing \u201cfree births\u201d, with no medical support, and how the society is now linked to the deaths of newborn babies around the world.</p><p>FBS, a multimillion dollar business, promotes a version of free birth, otherwise known as unassisted birth, that is seen as extreme, even among advocates of the practice. Unlike home births, which have a midwife in attendance, free birth involves delivering without medical assistance. The FBS advises mothers to steer clear of doctors and midwives, is anti-ultrasound (which it falsely claims harms babies) and downplays serious medical conditions, the Guardian found.</p><p><em><strong>Ukraine </strong></em>| European countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/23/trump-ukraine-zero-gratitude-peace-plan-international-talks\">proposed a radical alternative</a> Ukraine peace plan on Sunday that omits some of the pro-Russia points made in the original US-backed document and calls for Kyiv\u2019s sovereignty to be respected.</p><p><em><strong>Politics </strong></em>| Rachel Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/23/rachel-reeves-benefit-fraud-crackdown-two-child-limit-budget\">will launch</a> a fresh crackdown on benefit fraud, alongside scrapping the two-child welfare limit and freezing rail fares, while putting forward a multibillion-pound tax-raising package.</p><p><em><strong>Media </strong></em>| The BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/23/bbc-to-expand-standards-panel-and-add-deputy-director-general-after-bias-row\">is planning to overhaul</a> the way it investigates editorial concerns, in a move that will dilute the influence of a Conservative figure accused of trying to sway its political impartiality.</p><p><em><strong>Skye Gyngell</strong></em> | Tributes have been paid to the pioneering chef and restaurant proprietor, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/nov/23/chef-skye-gyngell-who-pioneered-the-slow-food-movement-dies-aged-62\">died aged 62</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Politics</strong></em> | David Cameron has disclosed he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/23/david-cameron-reveals-he-has-prostate-cancer-and-calls-for-targeted-screening\">treated for prostate cancer</a> and has called for a targeted screening programme.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/monday-briefing-what-a-new-guardian-investigation-reveals-a-group-radicalising-women-into-unassisted-birth\">Continue reading...</a>",

Dita Parlo and Jean Dast\u00e9 play the newlyweds getting awkwardly accustomed to married life in close quarters, and their love story shapes the film. But it\u2019s their bargemate, the uncouth P\u00e8re Jules, played by Michel Simon, who steals the show: a well-travelled sailor speckled with tattoos, standing guard over a cabinet of risque and macabre curiosities, whose cabin teems with cats every bit as unruly as he is.</p><p>The Swiss actor Michel Simon was one of the most distinctive presences in 20th-century French cinema: a soft-faced, gravelly voiced clown capable of tremendous pathos, and true chaos. Charlie Chaplin called him \u201cthe greatest actor in the world\u201d. He worked with the best European directors on some timeless films. As well as acting for Vigo, he played the timid man transformed by his affair with a sex worker in La Chienne (1931) and the incorrigible tramp in Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932) for Jean Renoir. He worked with Marcel Carn\u00e9 in films such as Le Quai des Brumes (1938), with Carl Theodor Dreyer in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), with Ren\u00e9 Clair, Marcel L\u2019Herbier, Julien Duvivier, GW Pabst \u2026 even John Frankenheimer in The Train (1964). \u201cWhen Michel Simon plays a part,\u201d said Truffaut, \u201cwe penetrate the core of the human heart.\u201d He spent five decades working in the cinema, starting out in the silents, and received his highest accolade, the Berlinale\u2019s Best Actor award in 1967, for his role as an antisemitic peasant befriending a young Jewish boy during the war in The Two of Us (Claude Berri). Reviewing that movie, Renata Adler called Simon \u201can enormous old genius \u2026 the general impression is that of an immense, thoughtful, warm-hearted and aquatic geological formation\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/michel-simon-latalante-jean-vigo\">Continue reading...</a>",

I love to kickstart December with Advent calendars for all the family, so it seemed only fair to taste test this lot with them in tow. And, despite an age range spanning 60-plus years, we were all pretty much on the same page with our expectations: we were looking for a bit of variety behind the doors, some Christmas sparkle and a hint of nostalgia. Packaging that looked the part when displayed on our mantelpiece was also an important consideration.</p><p>Despite the obvious biases (the kids being attracted to the calendars aimed at them v the adults preferring the slightly more elegant offerings), the results were pretty consistent. We all loved the calendars where there was something extra: a picture behind a door or a foil barrier to break through, a variation in the chocolates and so forth. Ultimately, that just goes to show that we\u2019re all big kids at heart \u2013 and that every day should start with a miniature chocolate treat.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/nov/22/best-chocolate-advent-calendars-uk\">Continue reading...</a>",

Even so, their camaraderie shines through as Brandy quickly breaks character to sway and sing along to Monica\u2019s Don\u2019t Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days), a showcase for her slightly raspy, soulful vocals during which she winds her hips and aims gun fingers at the audience.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/brandy-monica-concert-review-new-york\">Continue reading...</a>",

It takes a spark of something dazzling, even dangerous, to notice a single detail \u2013 an orchid, say \u2013 and from this to extrapolate a 20-person luau. A while later, Stewart wrote about the party in Entertaining, her 1982 cookbook debut, lushly photographed and with step-by-step instructions for chicken wings with banana. \u201cThe pig wore a necklace of starfruit,\u201d she explained.

It\u2019s <a href=\"https://heyrini.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooUkJHuHTtmYx\">early days for Rini</a>, whose sole product is now a Korean-made hydrating facial mask. A healing ointment and daily barrier cream are allegedly in the works, too. If you were under any illusions as to the mask\u2019s purpose, it is infused with vitamin B12 \u2013 which, according to various skincare sites, improves elasticity and skin texture \u2013 with a clear peel-on application process modelled online, Patrick Bateman-style, by a preschooler.</p><p>On the one hand, I appreciate that children put all sorts on their faces \u2013 face paint, stickers, poo, toothpaste, kitchen cleaner, a sibling\u2019s blood, and that\u2019s just in this last week alone \u2013 and that their faces will occasionally need to be cleaned.

Her 2022 breakthrough, The Long Count, featured woozy, ambient soundscapes made from electronically processed samples of ancient Maya flutes. On her latest record, Desaceleradas (Decelerated), Beatriz turns her attention to the 90s trend of <em>cumbia rebajada</em>. Slowing the Afro-Latin dance genre of <em>cumbia</em> to a sludgy tempo, <em>cumbia rebajada</em> is a dub-influenced take on a typically upbeat, party-driven sound. DJ Gabriel Due\u00f1ez popularised the style with his bootleg cassettes; two of his earliest releases now form the basis of Beatriz\u2019s experiments.</p><p>Landing somewhere between composer William Basinski\u2019s Disintegration Loops and DJ Screw\u2019s chopped\u2019n\u2019screwed production style, Desaceleradas slows the shaker-rattling, synth syncopations of <em>cumbia rebajada</em> into unrecognisable ambient territory. La Ronda y el Sonidero and Vinilos Trasnacionales contain hints of the signature <em>cumbia</em> shuffle and twanging synth melody, but Beatriz\u2019s added tape hiss, reverb and melodic warping transform the style into an eerie, ethereal soundworld of nightmare fairground music and yearning drones.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/debit-desaceleradas-review-afro-latin-club-sounds-slowed-to-a-seductive-crawl\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p><strong>(Mass Appeal)</strong><br />The first release since the death of their founding member dwells on the afterlife, yet doesn\u2019t forsake their perpetually sunny sound</p><p>Cabin in the Sky, the tenth album by De La Soul \u2013 and first since the 2023 death of founding member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/13/a-new-style-of-speak-the-lyrical-genius-of-trugoy-the-dove\">Trugoy the Dove</a>, AKA Dave Jolicoeur \u2013 is, loosely, a concept album about death and the afterlife. A spoken-word intro by actor Giancarlo Esposito primes you for something heavy, but you are instantly reminded, of course, that this is a De La Soul album: it seems practically impossible that their brand of lackadaisical, perpetually sunny plunderphonics could ever feel like a drag. The lush strings of Yuhdontstop introduce an album that\u2019s always projected in full-saturation Technicolor: from the effervescent Natalie Cole sample on Will Be to Maseo\u2019s jovial, avuncular ad-libs that open Cruel Summers Bring Fire Life!!, Cabin in the Sky feels warm and rich in vitamin D, a tonic for chillier months.</p><p>For the most part, the afterlife theme seems to have been tacked on, likely after Trugoy\u2019s death; the album still features his vocals, and most of the songs on the album fit squarely in De La Soul\u2019s already established surrealist world. (Patty Cake, a minimalist highlight, reinterprets classic schoolyard chants, a conceit that somehow hasn\u2019t already been done on a De La Soul record.) Even so, lasting more than 70 minutes, Cabin in the Sky can feel like a slog, with the end lacking the sprightliness of the album\u2019s first half. An exception is the title track, on which Maseo and Pos pay tribute to Trugoy and others they\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s pensive and world-weary, but never loses its sense of magic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/de-la-soul-cabin-in-the-sky-review-a-full-colour-celebration-of-trugoy-the-dove-that-never-feels-heavy\">Continue reading...</a>",

Living a middle-class existence in London, he is suddenly widowed; one of the movie\u2019s off-target qualities is its refusal to specify the cause of death or even show us clearly what his wife looked like, which in real life would be unbearably vivid facts. Sam Spruell has a quietly sympathetic role as Cumberbatch\u2019s brother.</p><p>Left to look after their two young boys, he succumbs to a kind of breakdown, and hallucinates a giant nightmarish crow, which after a while the boys can sense too. The crow is derisively voiced by David Thewlis, and resembles the Ted-Hughes-ish illustrations Cumberbatch was working on. It sneeringly, ruthlessly mocks and jeers at his \u201csad dad\u201d anguish; while everyone else is walking on eggshells around him, perhaps making things worse, the brutal crow jabs its beak into his psychic wound.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/20/the-thing-with-feathers-review-benedict-cumberbatch-max-porter-grief\">Continue reading...</a>",

The trick is not going OTT</p><p>Once a decade or so, the urban-centric fashion world discovers this delightful concept called The Countryside. With the vanishingly scant levels of self-awareness that are fashion\u2019s default setting, it then proceeds to immediately and loudly tell the world about it. There are so many trees!

It is a surrealist film whose surrealism resides not merely in the bizarre parched landscape of the Sierra Morena mountain range with its bleached skulls, hanged bandits, crows and mysterious inns in which seductive encounters are to be had, but also simply in the bewildering juxtaposition of individual tales and anecdotes, stories which grow out of each other. The surrealist effect (and the comedy) is in the jolt from one micro-narrative to the other, and the realisation that the overall story is thwarted and undermined.</p><p>The premise is that in the Spanish town of Saragossa during the Napoleonic wars, one officer tries to arrest another, who is apparently reading an old book \u2013 but is then distracted by the fact that this book is about his own grandfather, the nobleman Alfonse Van Worden. (Later we discover that the passages about this grandfather have been added by hand, in pen-and-ink, hence Saragossa Manuscript.) Then we flash back to this preening aristocrat-soldier himself, played by prominent Polish actor Zbigniew Cybulski.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/19/the-saragossa-manuscript-review-cult-polish-period-costume-comedy-is-outrageous-head-spinner\">Continue reading...</a>",

His brilliant work meant he was admired and even hero-worshipped by musicians and producers on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a classically trained Englishman (like Elton John at about the same time, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music) yet sounded as if he learned piano in the Mississippi Delta.

Pacini plays Jeanne, a teenage girl in a foster home nearby, stricken with memories of the death of her mother, whose bead necklace she keeps. In her loneliness and grief, Jeanne has projected her feelings into an obsession with the story of the Snow Queen, an obsession further displaced at another remove into idolising the teen girls who ice-skate at the local rink. One day she runs away, stealing the ID of an older girl called Bianca and breaks into the film studio to sleep overnight; she somehow gets a job as an extra, astonished to realise what story is being filmed, and it is here that her gamine prettiness and air of demurely sensitive adoration for the queen catches Cristina\u2019s eye.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/16/the-ice-tower-review-marion-cotillard-focus-of-obsession-and-idolisation-in-death-wish-fairytale\">Continue reading...</a>",

This documentary narrated by Imelda Staunton tells the story of the campaign to hold the Irish government to account for its role in the laundries, mother and baby homes and industrial schools for children.

    "summary": "<p>Punchy, old-school stunt work, inventive baddie-splattering and a simple plot as our grizzled Finish prospector finds a new foe in his Soviet-occupied homeland</p><p>In 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/sisu-review-nazi-killing\">Finnish indie action movie Sisu</a> had the look of a one-hit wonder. Pitting a grizzled prospector against an entire platoon of Nazis, writer-director Jalmari Helander heeded the lessons of George Miller\u2019s Mad Max: Fury Road, principally that there is serious cinematic value in going pedal-to-the-metal along a single, straight narrative line. That profitable sleeper hit now yields this choice follow-up, which somehow feels more expansive while still clocking in under 90 minutes.</p><p>Having seen off the SS, indomitable hero Aatami (Jorma Tommila) gains a tragic backstory and a new, vicious postwar foe in the tremendously named Red Army butcher Igor Draganov, played by wily James Cameron favourite Stephen Lang. Again, the economy of Helander\u2019s approach proves striking and thrilling. No unnecessary obstacles have been placed between the audience and a good time at the movies: we get one scene of Aatami dismantling his family home beam by beam and one scene of Draganov being sprung from jail before the pair intersect in the back roads of Soviet-occupied Finland. Cutting to the chase grants Helander time to craft set pieces in which Aatami outthinks and outflanks the Red Army\u2019s might; in this respect, Sisu 2 is a more-of-the-same sequel. The good news is that it remains terrific: punchy, old-school stunt work, crisply uncluttered cutting, and varied, inventive baddie-splattering from the moment Aatami deploys one of those beams to take down a jet fighter.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/19/sisu-road-to-revenge-review-finnish-hero-takes-on-a-red-army-butcher-in-terrific-sequel\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>Bringing her black-belt screen presence to the role of Elphaba, Erivo leads a fine cast in a zingily scored conclusion to the hit origin story</p><p>Director Jon M Chu pulls off quite a trick with this manageably proportioned second half to the epic musical prequel-myth inspired by The Wizard of Oz \u2013 and based, of course, on the hit stage show. It keeps the rainbow-coloured dreaminess and the Broadway show tune zinginess from part one, and we still get those periodic, surreal pronouncements given by the city\u2019s notables to the diverse folk of Oz, those non-player characters crowding the streets. But now the focus narrows to the main players and their explosive romantic crises, essentially through two interlocking love triangles: Glinda the Good, Elphaba the Wicked and the Wizard \u2013 and Glinda, Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, the handsome young military officer with whom both witches are not so secretly in love, as well as possibly having feelings for each other.</p><p>Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the Wizard, who pretty much becomes the Darth Vader of Oz: a slippery carnival huckster who is realising that his seedy charm is corroding his soul. Jonathan Bailey pivots to a much more serious, less campy, more passionate Prince and Ariana Grande is, as ever, delicate and doll-like as Glinda, though with less opportunity for comedy. But the superstar among equals is Cynthia Erivo, bringing her black-belt screen presence to the role of Elphaba, and revealing a new vulnerability and maturity. Elsewhere, Marissa Bode returns as Nessarose, Elphaba\u2019s wheelchair-using half-sister; Ethan Slater is Boq, the Munchkin working as her servant; and Michelle Yeoh brings stately sweetness to the role of the Wizard\u2019s private secretary Madame Morrible.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/18/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jeff-goldblum\">Continue reading...</a>",

When I hear a phrase in my head it is free of the confines of bar lines, but, in practical application, eventually it needs to get squeezed into recognisable shapes and containers. Every composer has their own strategy (some eschew bar lines entirely, or use alternative notational strategies outside the traditional western systems), but it\u2019s always a negotiation: does the way the composer notates the rhythm correspond to how it should best appear on the flute player\u2019s music stand?</p><p>I have distinct memories of being 13, hearing a piece (specifically, Stravinsky\u2019s Symphony in Three Movements), basically memorising it from the recording, and then being absolutely shocked when I finally saw the score. \u201cThat\u2019s where the downbeat is?!\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s sense of time and my understanding of the same were at variance in a way I still find exciting: the idea that there are infinite superimpositions of a practical system (notation) over a medium (sound) most often experienced by an audience without the score.

Nowadays you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the Nintendo Entertainment System was the only console available in the mid-to-late 1980s. If you were brought up in Nintendo\u2019s target markets of Japan and North America, this chunky contraption essentially <em>was</em> the only game in town \u2013 the company had Mario after all, and its vice-like hold on third-party developers created a monopoly for major titles of the era. But in Europe, where home computers ruled the era, the NES was beaten by a technologically superior rival.</p><p>The Sega Master System was originally released in Japan in the autumn of 1985 as the Sega Mark III. Based around the famed Z80 CPU (used in home computers such as the Spectrum, Amstrad and TRS-80) and a powerful Sega-designed video display processor, it boasted 8kb of RAM, a 64-colour palette and the ability to generate 32 sprites on screen at one time \u2013 making the NES (based on the older 6502 processor) look like an ancient relic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/18/sega-master-system-nintendo-entertainment-system\">Continue reading...</a>",

Hay meadows and wetland forest add marsh thistle, reed orchids, alders and willows to the list. Ribboned with well-marked hiking and cycling trails, the proximity to nature draws spring and summer tourists but treasures can be found there in autumn and winter too; among them thousands of ducks and geese, and some of the starriest skies in the Netherlands.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/nov/18/wetlands-wildlife-slow-travel-friesland-netherlands\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>As his sequel to Wicked prepares to storm Christmas, the director talks about the dynamism of Grande and Cynthia Erivo  \u2013 and why his Wizard of Oz riff is quite simply one of the greatest stories of our time</p><p>Let\u2019s start with a quick recap on the first Wicked film. Its premise: what would the legend of Oz look like, told from the perspective of someone other than that cute but dozy blow-in, Dorothy? The wicked witch, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), is entirely green, and has therefore been ostracised since childhood. Glinda (Ariana Grande), the good witch, is everybody\u2019s princess but, after a time, the two become best friends. I\u2019ll skirt over how the Tin Man, the Lion and the Scarecrow come about, suffice to say that, in the film at least, their backstories make perfect and resonant sense (except for the Lion, but never mind). The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) is not a good guy \u2013 but is he a bad guy? The morals swirl, in an expertly handled way.</p><p>The first film left us at the point of discovery that Oz, far from being a magic paradise, was actually built on foundations of discrimination, oppression, enslavement and mendacity \u2013 or, if you like things simple, fascism. The fact that the slave-caste is the animal kingdom rather than a human out-group doesn\u2019t make this opulent fantasia feel any less pointedly topical. \u201cAny timeless story feels timely,\u201d director Jon M Chu says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about the human condition. When people become too powerful, what happens to the powerless? That cycle, unfortunately, challenges us every few generations, and maybe this is our moment. We\u2019re the adults in the room now.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/17/jon-m-chu-interview-director-wicked-for-good-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-wizard-of-oz\">Continue reading...</a>",

The exterior of <a href=\"https://www.abadessa.com/\">Palazzo Abadessa</a>, tucked away in the sleepy backstreets of the Cannaregio district, is low key enough, but the grandeur and opulence begin to hit your senses as you explore. First we strolled through the lush ornamental garden, then the huge entrance hall decorated with frescoes and Renaissance paintings going back to the golden age of Venice, lit by glittering Murano chandeliers. The reception area is furnished with an antique velvet armchair, perfect for sipping a prosecco or Venetian spritz. Back in the 16th century, the original owners provided Venice with two of its doges, and today the stone corridors and high-ceilinged rooms have a classy, noble air, as if the ghosts of Caravaggio or Tintoretto might appear any moment and begin painting. Breakfast of cappuccino and croissants in the courtyard served by the friendly owners was a delightful way to start the day.<br /><strong>April</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/nov/14/we-stayed-in-a-500-year-old-palazzo-for-100-readers-favourite-historic-places-to-stay-in-europe\">Continue reading...</a>",

But here is Black Ops 7, a year after its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/29/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review\">direct predecessor</a>, and another breathless bombard of military shooting action.

The campaign mode, which represents just a quarter of the offering this year, is a hallucinogenic romp through socio-political talking points such as psychopathic corporations, hybrid warfare, robotics and tech oligarchies. The result is a deafening onslaught of massive shootout set-pieces in exotic locations, as the four lead characters \u2013 members of a supercharged spec-ops outfit \u2013 are exposed to a psychotropic drug that makes them relive their worst nightmares. Luckily, they do so with advanced weaponry, cool gadgets and enough buddy banter to destabilise a medium-sized rogue nation. It is chaotic, relentless and stupidly pleasurable, especially if you play in co-operative mode with three equally irresponsible pals.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/14/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-playstation-xbox-pc\">Continue reading...</a>",

The Hekes are a working-class Maori family in South Auckland: Temuera Morrison is the boozing, brawling, bragging alpha-male welfare claimant Jake, who comes home from drinking in the pub with his pathetic sycophant mates to terrorise and assault his wife Beth, played by Rena Owen, and their five children. He is entirely indifferent to the fate of his two elder sons who have drifted into gangland culture and crime, as well as his sensitive daughter Grace, who has talent as a writer. One son gets gang tattoos; the other is taken to a juvenile reformatory where he is at least tutored in the ways of Maori culture \u2013 the haka and the taiaha warrior spear \u2013 and learns dignity and self-respect. But back at Jake\u2019s chaotic house, Grace is raped by Jake\u2019s grotesque friend \u201cUncle Bully\u201d; disaster follows, and Beth passionately confronts the wretched Jake: \u201cOur people once were warriors, but unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit \u2026\u201d</p><p>Tamahori let rip with all this emotional violence, and landed sledgehammer punches with the pub scenes, the home scenes and the gang ritual initiation scenes, handling them with confidence and verve. He created a gutsy, heartfelt picture with a very 90s streak of brash and trash. It was a hit with audiences and critics, and \u2013 for good or ill \u2013 deeply impressed industry executives in Hollywood who could see how Tamahori could bring this energy and flair to mainstream genre material.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/07/lee-tamahori-once-were-warriors\">Continue reading...</a>",

She brought an authentic, undiluted American screen-acting flavour to everything she was in, and ran hugely successful movie and TV careers in parallel for decades, playing waitresses, neighbours, moms, sirens and daughters, and ranging from comedy to drama.</p><p>She was famously the mother of screen actor Laura Dern and wife of Bruce Dern, and repeatedly acted with Laura in a remarkable mother-daughter partnership in which the two women\u2019s closeness always shone through. You might compare it to Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli, or Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher \u2014 although Diane Ladd and Laura Dern were far more trouble-free and without that kind of angst. They were Oscar-nominated together for their joint appearance in Martha Coolidge\u2019s Depression drama Rambling Rose from 1991. And they also both appeared in David Lynch\u2019s Wild at Heart and Inland Empire, Alexander Payne\u2019s Citizen Ruth, and in Mike White\u2019s HBO drama Enlightened \u2013 and in three of these they played, naturally, a mother and daughter.

It was the summer of 2000 and DeJohnette was in London to play with Keith Jarrett\u2019s Standards Trio. Referring to him in my first question as a \u201cdrummer\u201d felt reasonable enough, but DeJohnette didn\u2019t appreciate being pigeonholed and shot back instantly: \u201cI\u2019m a complete musician.\u201d A few days later, sitting in the Royal Festival Hall watching the Standards Trio, a moment of transcendent magic thrilled me as Jarrett sustained a long sequence of repeated notes high up on the piano and DeJohnette powered the music forwards with a labyrinthian drum solo as harmonically searching as anything Jarrett had played. Complete musician indeed.</p><p>\u201cThe idea of improvisation,\u201d DeJohnette told me, \u201cis tied up in the very nature of our existence. We don\u2019t expect our life to evolve without changing and we never know what\u2019s round the corner \u2013 why should music be any different?\u201d He further explained that each part of his drum kit he considered to be a musical being \u201cin its own right\u201d. He designed and tuned his cymbals to his own specification. Mix the sound of cymbals with the drums and then \u201cyou think harmonically on the kit,\u201d he added. The sounds inside DeJohnette\u2019s head could never be contained by the conventions of drum technique. He was also a pianist of considerable merit \u2013 who released a solo piano album, Return, in 2016 \u2013 and every facet of his musicianship seemed to be on display all of the time, until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/27/jack-dejohnette-versatile-jazz-drummer-miles-davis-fusion-dies-aged-83\">his death this week aged 83</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/27/jack-dejohnette-was-more-than-a-jazz-drummer-his-staggering-range-made-him-a-superhuman-force-in-music\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>Hawke plays with campy brilliance and criminal combover the lyricist Lorenz Hart as he spirals into vinegary jilted despair after his split from Richard Rodgers</p><p>Breaking up with the more prominent partner in a showbiz double act is a hazardous business. Larry David did it. So did Andrew Ridgeley. Now this witty and heartbreakingly sad chamber piece from screenwriter Robert Kaplow and director Richard Linklater tells the all but unbearable story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart just after his split from Richard Rodgers. He is played with campy brilliance, an unspeakable combover and fake smallness by Ethan Hawke, who is often digitally reduced in size \u2013 but is also occasionally filmed standing in an off-camera hole to look up poignantly at taller characters, facing Hart\u2019s vertical challenge as Jos\u00e9 Ferrer once played the diminutive Toulouse-Lautrec.</p><p>Hawke gets big, world-weary laughs with Hart\u2019s riffs on the hidden gayness of the movie Casablanca and the cheesily upbeat musical he\u2019s just been to see, with all the lasso-twirling cowboys; he acidly calls it Okla-homo. The sexual identity of Hart is complex: this film effectively triangulates his gayness with the straight persona invented for him in the 1948 musical Words and Music (with Mickey Rooney playing Hart); it cleverly extrapolates a kind of bisexuality from Hart\u2019s letters to his protege: young Yale student and would-be stage designer Elizabeth Weiland, played here with heedless girlishness by Margaret Qualley.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/16/blue-moon-review-ethan-hawke-richard-linklater-broadway-hart-rodgers\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p>From luxury Simba and Otty mattresses to brilliant budget buys, here\u2019s what we recommend \u2013 and how to know if you\u2019ve found a good deal<br /><strong><br />\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/oct/05/best-mattress-back-pain-expert-recommended-uk\"><strong>The best mattresses for back pain</strong></a><strong><br />\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/31/best-mattress-toppers-uk\"><strong>The best mattress toppers, tested</strong></a></p><p>A good mattress improves your sleep, say mattress makers \u2013 and they would, wouldn\u2019t they?

These days, I won\u2019t get a single one of 40 winks if I\u2019m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.</p><p>Today\u2019s best mattresses promise all this and more.
