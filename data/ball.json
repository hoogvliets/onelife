Because Williamson has struggled to consistently be healthy enough to play, he is considered to have negative trade value.

The Knicks and Bucks had trade conversations about it. They weren't able to come to a deal. But I promise you it wasn't the Bucks' idea to have those negotiations. I promise you the Knicks got the call to ask and start the trade conversations because they didn't think it was coming.</p>\n<p>\"So did Giannis come and sit with ownership and say 'trade me'. He did not, but he was interested in it. Here we are again and there's interest in Giannis' side in maybe making a change.</p>\n<p>\"Will he go forward and take the next step and say 'trade me'? This is what the league wants to know. Because in the past we have gotten here and he has not gone to the line and has not said 'I want to be traded.'</p>\n<p>\"The second thing is if he gets to that line, will the list include more than just the Knicks? Because in the summer, it was just the Knicks. If the list includes more than just the Knicks, will Giannis get to control the trade?\"</p>\n<p>The Knicks are unlikely to have the best offer for Antetokounmpo as they don't currently have any <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/tradeable\">tradeable first round picks</a>, but they do have four swaps available. </p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo becomes eligible on October 1, 2026 for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season and <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/free-agent-details\">could become a free agent as early as 2027</a>. If Antetokounmpo is traded, he can sign the same extension with his new team six months after the deal.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, a trade involving Antetokounmpo becomes far easier for the Bucks to execute in the offseason when there are fewer restrictions in place.</p>",

The Thunder became just the fourth team in league history to win at least 21 of their first 22 games.</p>\n<p>Kerr coached the 2015-16 Warriors to a 73-9 record and played on the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls team that went 72-10. He cited the Thunder's high basketball IQ and connected roster as reasons they could shatter the record.</p>\n<p>\"Overall, (it takes) a team mindset of zero agendas - just win every night,\" Kerr said before tipoff. \"Obviously (it takes) great talent. But I think (it's also) high IQ from players. The two teams that you're referring to that I was part of (the Bulls and Warriors) both had really, really high IQs - individually and as a team. That's what I see in OKC.\"</p>\n<p>Warriors forward Draymond Green, a key member of the 73-win team, agreed the Thunder are capable of the feat despite the difficulty involved.</p>\n<p>\"It's hard, man, but I do think they're capable,\" Green told The Athletic after the game. \"You just need so many things to go right, though - from health, (although) they kind of plow right through health (issues), so it don't matter, it seems. You need a lot of breaks to go your way, but they're on the right track.\"</p>\n<p>The Thunder's 15.1 net rating leads the NBA by a wide margin, with Houston second at 10.9.

Peterson has been sidelined for the last six games and entered the season as the projected No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Coach Bill Self addressed Peterson's status in a statement released before the game.

    "summary": "<p>Ja Morant has displayed markedly improved leadership and engagement while sidelined with a calf injury as the Memphis Grizzlies have won five of their last six games to climb to 9-12. The shift comes after early-season turmoil that saw Morant suspended one game by the team in October, which subsequently led to speculation about his future with the franchise.</p>\n<p>Morant was suspended following his critical comments to reporters after an October 31 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. He has been out since mid-November with a calf injury after struggling through 12 games to start the season.</p>\n<p>During Sunday's victory over the Sacramento Kings, Morant was engaged from the bench throughout the game. Tuomas Iisalo and teammates noted his active coaching presence and improved communication. Iisalo emphasized Morant's value even while injured.</p>\n<p>\"It's a huge advantage for us,\" Iisalo said. \"He's asking stuff of me and giving some tips there for the guys. Overall, really good communication, really good leadership, both from him and also from Jaren (Jackson Jr.) and our veteran guys.\"</p>\n<p>Jaren Jackson Jr. confirmed Morant's active involvement.</p>\n<p>\"He's a coach right now,\" Jackson said. \"He's coaching, just like he does with 'Twelve-Time' in AAU. He knows the game. He's a point guard. So they kind of see the floor very well. And he just says what he's seeing, talking us through things.\"</p>\n<p>Morant remains subject to league-wide trade speculation despite the recent improvements. His contract carries $87 million over the next two seasons, and rival executives view his trade value as depressed due to health concerns and controversies.</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies have rebounded from a 4-11 start and currently sit in playoff position in the Western Conference. They are 3.5 games behind the sixth seed.</p>\n<p>Morant's initial return timeline targeted early December.

    "title": "Sports Venues Prioritize Luxury Seating As Premium Spaces Drive Revenue",
    "summary": "<p>Modern sports arenas are increasingly designed around premium seating experiences, with luxury offerings now accounting for up to 50 percent of total ticketing revenue despite occupying only 20 percent of available seats. This shift represents a fundamental transformation in how venues generate income, according to a recent analysis in The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, home of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, exemplifies this trend with 260 premium suites across 12 categories. The venue's owner's suites reportedly cost around $1 million annually with 10-year commitments.</p>\n<p>Bill Dorsey, founder of the Association of Luxury Suite Directors, confirmed the industry-wide pattern. At SoFi, premium seating generates more than half of ticket revenue. By comparison, Lambeau Field's premium sections represent only 10 percent of total seating.</p>\n<p>The transformation began as teams sought to escape outdated municipal facilities. Jay Cross, a developer who oversaw business operations for the Miami Heat and New York Jets, explained the evolution.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of these teams were playing in antiquated facilities with old leases where they were making payments to the municipality,\" Cross said. \"The municipality probably wasn't maintaining the building, and it wasn't doing a good job of selling sponsorships. And, at the same time, people were beginning to see the importance of suite income. So that really kind of changed the game.\"</p>\n<p>Cross noted the architectural philosophy shift from earlier eras.</p>\n<p>\"If you go back to the classic ballparks, they were built as venues of respite for the working man,\" Cross said. \"You worked all day in a garment factory, and then on the weekend you went to a ballgame with your family and friends, and it wasn't so dissimilar to their work environment. But by the time we got to these nineties venues we were building arenas like shopping malls, putting down terrazzo and tile floors. I'm not altogether sure it was a good change.\"</p>\n<p>The financial model evolved dramatically since the 1980s. Tom Wilson pioneered moving luxury seating from upper decks to lower levels at the Palace of Auburn Hills in 1988. This strategy, combined with long-term suite leases, transformed stadium financing.</p>\n<p>The average cost for a family of four to attend an NFL game now exceeds $1,300, including parking and concessions. Premium seating at venues like SoFi can reach $2,000 per game for club seats and $50,000 per game for suites.</p>\n<p>Dynamic pricing has further complicated ticket access. Prices fluctuate based on demand, team performance, and opponent quality. The system allows venues to capture revenue previously claimed by resellers.</p>\n<p>New York City Football Club's upcoming Etihad Park stadium will dedicate 20 percent of seating to premium offerings. Brad Sims, the club's president and CEO, acknowledged he wished they had allocated 30 percent or more to high-end options.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone says that they want more premium and more super-high-end premium, especially in the past couple of years,\" Sims told The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>Capital One Arena in Washington, home of the Washington Wizards, recently reopened with expanded premium offerings, including subterranean vault suites with courtside access leasing for over $1 million annually.</p>",

    "title": "Bulls Model Offense After Pacers' Fast-Paced System",
    "summary": "<p>The Chicago Bulls transformed their offensive system after studying the Indiana Pacers' run to the NBA Finals last season. Billy Donovan implemented a 14-second shot clock during player-driven workouts in Miami before training camp to accelerate the team's pace. The Bulls jumped from 28th in the NBA in pace in 2023-24 to second in 2024-25.</p>\n<p>\"They stole our mojo,\" a Pacers team source told ESPN. \"They said before the season they were going to emulate our play style. Giddey playing the role as Tyrese. The fast pace, the late-game comebacks, wearing teams down.\"</p>\n<p>The Bulls looked at their final 20 games of last season when they went 14-6. They then studied the Pacers' roster construction and playing style built around multiple ball handlers and ball movement. Chicago saw a blueprint for what they could become if they followed the same course.</p>\n<p>\"That's who we have to be,\" Donovan said. \"We have to be better than the sum of our parts.\"</p>\n<p>Chicago acquired Josh Giddey from Oklahoma City in June 2024 to serve as the engine of their new system. The Bulls envisioned Giddey playing a similar role to Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton as a pass-first playmaker. Multiple Bulls team sources acknowledged the similarities between what they are building and Indiana's construction.</p>\n<p>However, sources cited two key differences between the franchises. The Pacers played stingier defense, ranking 13th in defensive efficiency last season. Indiana also paired a second star, Pascal Siakam, alongside Haliburton to reach the Finals.</p>\n<p>\"They have Haliburton, who is an All-Star, and they have Siakam,\" one Bulls source told ESPN. \"If Giddey can develop into an All-Star and be what Hali was, when do we pull the trigger to get our Siakam?\"</p>\n<p>Giddey is nearly averaging a triple-double this season with 20.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 9.3 assists. He is shooting a career-best 39.2 percent from three-point range. Chicago has eight players averaging double figures and ranks second in bench scoring.</p>\n<p>The Bulls started 6-1 this season with a top-10 pace and ranked seventh in offense and 10th in defense. Since then they have fallen to 9-10 and rank 23rd in both offense and defense. Chicago is giving up an average of 56.5 points in the paint during that stretch, third-most in the NBA.</p>\n<p>\"If you look at the teams, it's similar personnel,\" Giddey told ESPN. \"Tyrese obviously is an unbelievable player, but they don't have that one superstar. They've got a lot of really, really solid, good players. They defend collectively, and that's an area we need to get better at.\"</p>\n<p>Donovan emphasized that Indiana's physicality on defense often gets overlooked in discussions about their pace. The Bulls coach said Chicago's defensive evolution must continue to match what the Pacers accomplished. The team finished with an identical 39-43 record last season despite the pace transformation.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Bouna Ndiaye and Jeremy Medjana built Comsport into the premier agency for French basketball players and are credited with helping fuel the modern influx of French talent into the NBA. Spurs chief executive R.C. Buford said Ndiaye's work with Nicolas Batum, Rudy Gobert and others helped create the pipeline. The duo now represents Victor Wembanyama, whose story in a movie called \"The American Dream\" will be released in February.</p>\n<p>\"That has to be some reflection of the work that he has done with Batum and Rudy and the other people that he has represented and helped grow,\" Buford said.</p>\n<p>France won the silver medal at the last Olympics and two of the last three top NBA draft picks were French. Comsport has guided clients through deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars with Ndiaye based in Dallas and Medjana in Paris. The agency pitched Wembanyama when he was 15 after tracking him for five years.</p>\n<p>Ndiaye, 59, and Medjana, 53, founded the agency nearly 30 years ago but struggled financially for a decade. Ndiaye worked construction jobs and cleaned airplanes while Medjana taught elementary school and sold knockoff designer clothes. The agency went bankrupt after client Ronny Turiaf left before his first major NBA payday.</p>\n<p>\"You forget the struggle,\" Ndiaye said. \"Ten years, you're not making any money. You keep believing that you're going to make it.\"</p>\n<p>Their breakthrough came in 2005 when Ian Mahinmi became their first NBA first-round draft pick. Ndiaye bonded with Mahinmi's family over their shared African roots during the pitch meeting. The agency later signed Batum, Fournier and Gobert as they entered the NBA.</p>\n<p>In 2016, four Comsport clients signed contracts worth a combined $371 million. The previous year those players presented Ndiaye with a Rolex watch at his surprise 50th birthday party. The French government administered a seven-year recovery plan for the agency's finances before the turnaround.</p>\n<p>The agency still scouts talent at youth tournaments worldwide despite their success. Ndiaye recently arranged for Wembanyama to spend 11 days training in kung fu at a 1,500-year-old Buddhist temple in China. The unconventional offseason program reflected their hands-on approach to player development.</p>",

    "title": "WNBA, Players Extend CBA Deadline To January 9 Amid Ongoing Negotiations",
    "summary": "<p>The WNBA and WNBA Players Association agreed to extend the current collective bargaining agreement through January 9 as negotiations continue toward a new deal. The league announced the extension Sunday night shortly before the 11:59 p.m. ET deadline. The agreement includes an option for either party to terminate the extension with 48 hours' notice.</p>\n<p>The union proposed a six-week extension after initially discussing a 24-hour extension, according to sources. The league pushed for an extension of 21 days before both sides reached the compromise. This marks the second extension after the initial October 31 deadline was extended by 30 days last month.</p>\n<p>\"We expect substantive movement from the league within this window,\" the union said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The two sides have remained far apart on determining salary structure and revenue sharing systems. The WNBA proposed a deal in November featuring significant increases with maximum salaries exceeding $1.1 million and minimum salaries above $220,000. The league's minimum salary was $66,079 in 2025 while the supermax was $249,244.</p>\n<p>The WNBPA rejected the proposal as sources told ESPN players felt it lacked a system where the salary cap would grow sufficiently with the business. Players want a salary cap directly determined by basketball-related income similar to the NBA model. The current cap of $1,507,100 grows at a fixed rate of 3 percent annually under the existing CBA.</p>\n<p>The current agreement includes a separate revenue sharing provision granting direct payments if certain targets are met. This provision has not been triggered largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. Players are also pushing for minimum professional standards in facilities, codification of charter travel and expanded retirement and family planning benefits.</p>\n<p>The league stated it wants to substantially increase player salaries and cost commitments while incentivizing owners to continue investing. The WNBA's recent growth provides opportunity to shift from operating at losses to building sustained profitability. Both sides met frequently including Sunday as they exchanged updated proposals.</p>",

The Bucks are 8-12 and sit 11th in the Eastern Conference, two games out of a play-in spot.</p>\n<p>\"Nobody should have a personal agenda. Nobody should worry about what they want from themselves,\" said Antetokounmpo, who missed the previous four games with a groin strain. \"Worry only about winning mentality. Winning mindset. The more we can win the games, the more everything takes care of itself.\"</p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo criticized teammates for trying to carry too heavy an offensive load during injuries to him and Kevin Porter Jr. He said players focusing on their individual scoring opportunities undermines team culture and prevents Milwaukee from winning games.</p>\n<p>\"Can I make an excuse that we've played a lot of games and guys are tired and it's a huge load on people? Yeah,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Can I also make an excuse that's human nature when [Kevin Porter Jr.] goes down and myself goes down, it's human nature to think that you got to carry a load. ... Maybe it's a scoring load, maybe you got to make plays, maybe you think it is your opportunity to get more shots. ... But that's not how you win games. That's not how you build culture.</p>\n<p>\"At the end of the day, you got to come in, do your job, do what you're paid to do, defend ... do the little things. And sometimes, when you worry about doing the little things, all the other things add up. If you're so concerned about scoring the ball and get yourself going offensively and that doesn't work for you, now you feel like you cannot do nothing.\"</p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo said teammates are letting missed shots affect their performance for the rest of games. He emphasized the need to maintain competitive spirit regardless of individual offensive struggles.</p>\n<p>\"You cannot worry about one shot or two shots that you miss, which took four seconds out of the game to dictate 47 minutes, 56 seconds of the game,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"So, we got to get back to that mindset. We got to get into the mindset that we got to compete.\"</p>\n<p>\"We got to move the ball. We got to find open 3s, we got to run. We got to create spacing,\" Antetokounmpo said.</p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo played under a minutes restriction in his first game back from injury.

The sixth-year guard struggled with decision-making in crucial moments, including a late-game sequence where he failed to make himself available for an inbound pass.</p>\n<p>\"I just got to get used to being a point guard, going to get the rock at the end of the game, bringing it up, even though they pressure,\" Edwards said.</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes I'm thinking, let somebody bring it up and then come get it,\" Edwards said. \"Just to take the pressure off my teammates, I just got to bring the ball up the court and get us into an action.\"</p>\n<p>The Timberwolves lack viable point guard options with Mike Conley declining at age 38. Conley went 1-for-4 against the Thunder and Minnesota was outscored by 17 points in his 12:32 on court. Rob Dillingham, at 20 years old, is not ready for significant minutes in the role. <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/282920/Wolves-Emerging-As-Expected-Buyers-Ahead-Of-Trade-Deadline\">The Wolves are emerging with motivation on the trade market due to their need at the position</a>.</p>\n<p>Edwards has scored 41, 43 and 31 points in his last three games while increasing his playmaking responsibilities. Finch noted Edwards is handling double teams better than last season, though the team must find ways to reduce the defensive pressure he faces.</p>\n<p>\"With no designated point guard, I think I got to be the one to bring the ball up,\" Edwards said. \"It's just that simple, so we don't turn it over, get us into action, get my teammates shots.\"</p>",

Presti referenced Caro's mantra to \"turn every page\" multiple times during his annual preseason news conference in September.</p>\n<p>Five days before the Thunder opened training camp following their title victory, Presti delivered his traditional lengthy media session. He discussed the team's approach to the season while invoking Caro's exhaustive research methods as a guiding principle.</p>\n<p>Presti first publicly mentioned Caro in 2020 while reading \"Master of the Senate\" during the NBA bubble. In his September 2024 opening statement, he applied Caro's philosophy to team-building and roster management.</p>\n<p>\"One of my favorite authors, Robert Caro, has a great saying about research, where he says, 'You have to turn every single page,' and I really like that relative to what it is that we have to do in order to discover the team,\" Presti said.</p>\n<p>\"We have to really understand and go through every iteration to ensure that we're not shutting off potential pathways that could really help us or get us to another level, whether it's now or in the future. ... I think by turning every page, you give yourself every opportunity.\"</p>\n<p>The Thunder GM repeated the phrase throughout the news conference when discussing roster depth, midseason trades, and the team's commitment to staying curious. Presti emphasized that exceptional teams must be willing to explore every possibility.</p>\n<p>Caro, 90, told ESPN he was honored by Presti's admiration. The two-time Pulitzer Prize winner has worked since 1974 on a multivolume biography of President Lyndon Johnson.</p>\n<p>\"I am truly touched, if you want to know the truth,\" Caro said.</p>\n<p>The historian developed his \"turn every page\" philosophy in 1959 while working at Newsday. His managing editor Alan Hathaway instructed him to never assume anything during investigative reporting. That principle has shaped Caro's six-decade career.</p>\n<p>Caro, a lifelong basketball fan who attended New York Knicks championship games in 1970 and 1973, said he receives letters from people who have adopted his motto. Regarding the Thunder's title, he noted that players and coaches win championships, not authors.</p>\n<p>\"I love basketball,\" Caro says. \"I'm not very good at it, but I love it.\"</p>",

They allege he attempted to conceal the missed deadline from other owners before partially funding his share on June 9.</p>\n<p>The minority owners claim Ishbia converted a prior loan into equity to fund his contribution. They say he did not disclose the missed deadline because the operating agreement would have required him to offer minority owners the chance to buy unfunded units, potentially diluting his stake.</p>\n<p>\"We believe the evidence will show that Mr. Ishbia contrived a scheme to threaten our clients with massive dilution of their interests in the Suns if they failed to fund a capital call within ten days' notice, while at the same time hiding his own failure to fund by the deadline,\" said Michael Carlinsky, attorney for the minority owners.</p>\n<p>An Ishbia spokesman told Front Office Sports the contribution was \"timely\" and that the minority owners' argument represents \"a nonsensical rejection of money that he contributed through an appropriate debt to equity conversion.\"</p>\n<p>The Suns called the lawsuit \"a shameless shakedown dressed up as legal process\" in a statement. The team maintains Ishbia has invested hundreds of millions into the franchise and community.</p>\n<p>The filing alleges multiple instances of self-dealing, including a loan to the team at above-market rates. It also cites the sale of arena naming rights to Ishbia's company, United Wholesale Mortgage, without informing minority owners.</p>\n<p>The 10-year naming rights deal for the Mortgage Matchup Center was announced last month at nearly $115 million. The Suns defended the agreement as \"one of the largest in the NBA and no different than what other owners have done.\"</p>\n<p>The legal dispute began in August when the minority owners filed suit alleging mismanagement and lack of transparency.

    "summary": "<p>Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams missed his 18th game of the season on Sunday. Williams is recovering from offseason surgery on his right wrist and is reportedly closing in on a return. However, missing an 18th game means that Williams is no longer eligible for regular season awards, such as All-NBA.</p>\n<p>Players must appear in at least 65 games to be eligible for most NBA regular season awards.</p>\n<p>That has an impact on the rookie scale extension that Williams signed with the Thunder this offseason. Had Williams made an All-NBA team, his extension would have climbed beyond the base of 25% of the 2026-27 salary cap. Williams could have earned up to 30% of the cap, had he been named to the All-NBA First Team.</p>\n<p>Now, Williams' extension will start at 25% of the cap. That projects to $41.5 million for next season. Williams and big man Chet Holmgren will have identical five-year extensions, which will pay both players a projected $240.7 million through the 2030-31 season.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>The NBA has distinguished itself as \"the most investor-friendly league in North American pro sports,\" according to forensic accounting expert Jesse Silvertown, as the basketball world witnesses an unprecedented wave of franchise transactions. Nearly 25 percent of NBA franchises have changed hands since 2020, with three teams in the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers announcing sales this year alone at a collective valuation exceeding $20 billion.</p>\n<p>Silvertown, principal at forensic accounting firm Hesperus, tells Front Office Sports the NBA's investor-friendly environment stems from a higher cap on private capital, limited labor strife, and a lucrative long-term media-rights deal. These factors have positioned the league ahead of the NFL and MLB in facilitating ownership transitions.</p>\n<p>The league's $77 billion media-rights deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon represents a 220% increase from the prior agreement. This financial windfall has driven franchise valuations to historic levels, creating optimal conditions for legacy owners to exit.</p>\n<p>\"My guess is that this is the start of a trend,\" Tripp Crews of business valuation firm Mercer Capital tells FOS. \"The combination of soaring valuations and private equity gaining access to this new class of assets should create more of these transactions in the future.\"</p>\n<p>The NBA formalized private equity investment pathways in January 2021, allowing single PE funds to hold up to 20% stakes in as many as five teams. Major firms like Sixth Street, Dyal HomeCourt Partners, and Arctos Partners now hold stakes across multiple franchises.</p>\n<p>Most recent sales have been driven by aging owners, estate planning, or scandals, Silvertown notes. The sellers this year include owners in their mid-60s, while new buyers like Marc Lore, Alex Rodriguez, and Tom Dundon range from 50 to 56 years old.</p>\n<p>The league has seen 23 change-of-control sales since 2010, a dramatic increase from the 1990s when such transactions were rare and significantly less expensive.</p>\n<p>\"Economically, the choices are to become a real estate company around a new or updated arena, bring in PE money-which many who have not sold are doing-or both,\" Mark Cuban tells FOS.</p>",

We've gotta come ready to play. We just went through the motions today. Like, I don't understand it.\"</p>\n<p>The Celtics trailed 62-53 at halftime after surrendering 40 second-quarter points to Brooklyn.

A Josh Minott turnover with seven seconds remaining led to Brooklyn's final four points before halftime.</p>\n<p>Brown said his team didn't have the right effort \"for the majority of the game.\" He specifically pointed to late in the first half and the end of the third quarter as problematic stretches.</p>\n<p>\"Regardless if you're making or missing shots, regardless of anything, we've just got to come out and play with great energy, great enthusiasm for the game,\" Brown said. \"Like, want to win.

Johnson told Andscape that his breakthrough came from embracing the process and working with Lakers star LeBron James last offseason.</p>\n<p>The 23-year-old was selected 20th overall by Atlanta in 2021 after leaving Duke mid-season. He played 12 games in the G League as a rookie and averaged just 2.2 points in 22 NBA games his first season.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't understand how to look at it from a bigger picture point of view,\" Johnson said of his time in the G League. \"So, for me, being 18, 19 in the G League, all your friends see you get drafted first round and they are expecting you to play [in the NBA]. So, I let a lot of outside noises kind of distract me from what's really important. So those first couple games, I was just kind of down there just to be down there.</p>\n<p>\"I think it was a couple weeks later and a switch just happened - 'I needed to embrace this. This is my time to get minutes, get more reps underneath me.' Considering I left school early and all that, it was good for me just embracing that whole process, the good and the bad of it. I had to check myself. It was kind of like a reality check. 'You're not who you think you are yet, so you got to go down here, you got to put in the work and you got to do your time down here, and when your time number gets called you're going to be ready.'\"</p>\n<p>Johnson's career turned around when Quin Snyder became Hawks head coach on Feb. 26, 2023. Snyder instilled confidence and freedom while coaching him \"pretty hard,\" leading to a breakthrough 2023-24 season averaging 16 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 56 games.</p>\n<p>Johnson averaged 18.9 points and 10 rebounds through 33 games last season before a torn labrum required season-ending surgery. The Hawks finished 40-42 and were eliminated in the play-in tournament without him.</p>\n<p>\"I was in a tough spot, but those 36 games gave me the confidence that I would be right where I left off,\" Johnson said. \"It was hard leaving my team and the momentum we were building that season, especially coming off the [NBA Cup].\"</p>\n<p>Johnson worked out with James in Los Angeles during the offseason to improve his game.</p>\n<p>\"My time in the gym with him, I just enjoyed any knowledge he gave me,\" Johnson said of James. \"He just gave me little pointers. His work ethic, how he prepares, how he shows up before the workout and all that other stuff. I was really taking those small little pointers from him and just trying to implement it in my own routine. I was really just watching, man, just seeing how he moves and all that. It was great to have him around. I was blessed to be able to work with him.\"</p>\n<p>Johnson was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Nov. 10-16 after averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds, 9.3 assists and 2.5 steals as Atlanta went 4-0. He has led the Hawks since guard Trae Young was sidelined Oct. 29 with a sprained MCL.</p>\n<p>Atlanta awarded Johnson a five-year, $150 million contract extension in October 2024.</p>\n<p>\"Hard work really does pay off, and I'm a firm believer in that,\" Johnson said. \"One thing I learned about the NBA is not everybody wants to work.

The current CBA is set to expire November 30, just 10 days away.

A revenue sharing component combined with base salaries would enable these figures. The 2025 league minimum was $66,079 while the supermax reached $249,244.</p>\n<p>Sources told ESPN the union believes the proposal lacks a system where salaries grow sufficiently with the business. This has been a longstanding demand since players opted out of the current CBA in October 2024. Players want a structure similar to the NBA, where the salary cap is determined by basketball-related income.</p>\n<p>The league previously stated it proposed \"significant guaranteed salary cap increases and substantial uncapped revenue sharing that enables player salaries to grow as the league's business grows.\"</p>\n<p>The union responded that the proposal \"put lipstick on a pig and retread a system that isn't tied to any part of the business and intentionally undervalues the players.\"</p>\n<p>Under the current CBA, the salary cap increased annually by a fixed 3% rate. The 2025 salary cap stood at $1,507,100.
