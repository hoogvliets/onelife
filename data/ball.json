    "title": "DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine Spoke About Frustrations With Kings Season",
    "summary": "<p>After the Sacramento Kings were blown out by the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine spoke about the challenges the team is going through this season. Both DeRozan and LaVine talked about the issues they have as individuals and the frustrations the team has as a whole.</p>\n<p>When asked where the Kings are emotionally, DeRozan was blunt.</p>\n<p>\"In a s-ty place,\" DeRozan said. \"Don't nobody want to lose the way we've been losing. I think it's just everything right now for us is just s-ty, honestly. Sometimes when you're in the deep end, it's hard to hear anything. You're just trying to swim your way out, one way or another.\"</p>\n<p>DeRozan also expressed some uncertainty with his future in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>\"I'm pretty sure everything comes into question when you're in the situation like we're in now,\" DeRozan said. \"That's another thing that's frustrating. That's another thing. Only time will tell. We'll see.\"</p>\n<p>LaVine said he can't have the impact he's supposed to have if he's not able to play more aggressively.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not my best self when I take eight to 10 shots,\" LaVine said about his recent play. \"I can be as efficient as you want me to be. But if I'm taking eight shots, it's like, what are we doing? So today I just tried to be a little more aggressive, try to find spots, my teammates (were trying) to find me, which was great.</p>\n<p>\"But obviously it didn't result in anything like a win. I'd love to go 4-for-8 and we win. I scored a lot of points in my career. We're just trying to get a win right now. Gotta go sit on this flight. Got a day tomorrow. Got a game Saturday. Come Saturday, gotta figure it out.</p>\n<p>\"Only time will tell. It's hard to say right now. A lot of frustrations from a lot of angles. Still a lot of season left, still a lot that's in front of us. We gotta fight for something.\"</p>\n<p>LaVine said part of his frustration comes from not being on the floor late in some recent games.</p>\n<p>\"I'll always be a team guy,\" LaVine said. \"(But) personally, I don't like it. I've never not played in the fourth. But when you're trying to find a win, you do whatever you can, I guess.\"</p>",

The defeat dropped Boston back to 8-8 after winning three straight games to reach .500 for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>\"Come ready to play, or don't play at all,\" Brown said. \"That's my whole thing. We've gotta come ready to play. We just went through the motions today. Like, I don't understand it.\"</p>\n<p>The Celtics trailed 62-53 at halftime after surrendering 40 second-quarter points to Brooklyn.

A Josh Minott turnover with seven seconds remaining led to Brooklyn's final four points before halftime.</p>\n<p>Brown said his team didn't have the right effort \"for the majority of the game.\" He specifically pointed to late in the first half and the end of the third quarter as problematic stretches.</p>\n<p>\"Regardless if you're making or missing shots, regardless of anything, we've just got to come out and play with great energy, great enthusiasm for the game,\" Brown said. \"Like, want to win.

We have to be the best. We have to be sharp physically and mentally every night.\"</p>\n<p>Brown emphasized the need for his team to play with greater intensity moving forward.</p>\n<p>\"We need to play with an edge defensively and offensively,\" Brown said. \"Like, we've got to be the harder-playing team. That can't be negotiable. And tonight we weren't. Brooklyn was the harder-playing team. They played with more edge, and they deserved to win tonight.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Jaylen-Brown/Summary/52544\">Brown has a career high PER of 21.4 this season</a> as his usage has spiked to 35.6 without Jayson Tatum beside him in the lineup.

    "summary": "<p>Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson is averaging 22 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists in his fifth NBA season, emerging as a potential All-Star after a career marked by setbacks. Johnson told Andscape that his breakthrough came from embracing the process and working with Lakers star LeBron James last offseason.</p>\n<p>The 23-year-old was selected 20th overall by Atlanta in 2021 after leaving Duke mid-season. He played 12 games in the G League as a rookie and averaged just 2.2 points in 22 NBA games his first season.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't understand how to look at it from a bigger picture point of view,\" Johnson said of his time in the G League. \"So, for me, being 18, 19 in the G League, all your friends see you get drafted first round and they are expecting you to play [in the NBA]. So, I let a lot of outside noises kind of distract me from what's really important. So those first couple games, I was just kind of down there just to be down there.</p>\n<p>\"I think it was a couple weeks later and a switch just happened - 'I needed to embrace this. This is my time to get minutes, get more reps underneath me.' Considering I left school early and all that, it was good for me just embracing that whole process, the good and the bad of it. I had to check myself. It was kind of like a reality check. 'You're not who you think you are yet, so you got to go down here, you got to put in the work and you got to do your time down here, and when your time number gets called you're going to be ready.'\"</p>\n<p>Johnson's career turned around when Quin Snyder became Hawks head coach on Feb. 26, 2023. Snyder instilled confidence and freedom while coaching him \"pretty hard,\" leading to a breakthrough 2023-24 season averaging 16 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 56 games.</p>\n<p>Johnson averaged 18.9 points and 10 rebounds through 33 games last season before a torn labrum required season-ending surgery. The Hawks finished 40-42 and were eliminated in the play-in tournament without him.</p>\n<p>\"I was in a tough spot, but those 36 games gave me the confidence that I would be right where I left off,\" Johnson said. \"It was hard leaving my team and the momentum we were building that season, especially coming off the [NBA Cup].\"</p>\n<p>Johnson worked out with James in Los Angeles during the offseason to improve his game.</p>\n<p>\"My time in the gym with him, I just enjoyed any knowledge he gave me,\" Johnson said of James. \"He just gave me little pointers. His work ethic, how he prepares, how he shows up before the workout and all that other stuff. I was really taking those small little pointers from him and just trying to implement it in my own routine. I was really just watching, man, just seeing how he moves and all that. It was great to have him around. I was blessed to be able to work with him.\"</p>\n<p>Johnson was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Nov. 10-16 after averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds, 9.3 assists and 2.5 steals as Atlanta went 4-0. He has led the Hawks since guard Trae Young was sidelined Oct. 29 with a sprained MCL.</p>\n<p>Atlanta awarded Johnson a five-year, $150 million contract extension in October 2024.</p>\n<p>\"Hard work really does pay off, and I'm a firm believer in that,\" Johnson said. \"One thing I learned about the NBA is not everybody wants to work. You get the money and you get the nice things and all that other stuff, but the work is what really separates the ones that want to be something in this league.\"</p>",

    "title": "Anthony Davis Trade Return For Mavericks Likely Similar To Kevin Durant Deal",
    "summary": "<p>The Dallas Mavericks are expected to explore trading Anthony Davis before February's trade deadline, according to rival teams around the league. Any potential return would likely resemble the Kevin Durant trade to the Houston Rockets rather than the hauls Utah Jazz received for Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell in 2022. </p>\n<p>A Western Conference scout said <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed\">the depleted draft pick market around the league</a> limits Dallas's return options. <a href=\"https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/tradeable\">Teams lack the assets to offer multiple first-round selections</a>. The Mavericks should expect a couple of solid players and a draft pick in any deal.</p>\n<p>Davis has $121.2 million remaining after this season, with salaries of $58.4 million and $62.7 million over the next two years. He becomes extension eligible this coming offseason. The 32-year-old center could sign an extension worth up to three seasons and $218.5 million beginning August 6, 2026.</p>\n<p>Several league sources struggled to identify a deep list of potential suitors for Davis. His massive salary presents significant obstacles for teams operating near luxury tax thresholds. Dallas is already pushing against the second apron and likely wants to avoid adding long-term maximum salary commitments.</p>\n<p>Davis is in the first year of a three-year, $175 million extension he signed with the Lakers in August 2023. His injury history raises concerns about long-term value despite his elite production when healthy. He holds a player option worth $62.8 million for the 2027-28 season.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks face difficult decisions regarding their roster construction and salary cap flexibility. Moving Davis would provide significant financial relief while potentially addressing long-term team building concerns.</p>",

The current CBA is set to expire November 30, just 10 days away.

A revenue sharing component combined with base salaries would enable these figures. The 2025 league minimum was $66,079 while the supermax reached $249,244.</p>\n<p>Sources told ESPN the union believes the proposal lacks a system where salaries grow sufficiently with the business. This has been a longstanding demand since players opted out of the current CBA in October 2024. Players want a structure similar to the NBA, where the salary cap is determined by basketball-related income.</p>\n<p>The league previously stated it proposed \"significant guaranteed salary cap increases and substantial uncapped revenue sharing that enables player salaries to grow as the league's business grows.\"</p>\n<p>The union responded that the proposal \"put lipstick on a pig and retread a system that isn't tied to any part of the business and intentionally undervalues the players.\"</p>\n<p>Under the current CBA, the salary cap increased annually by a fixed 3% rate.

    "summary": "<p>LaMelo Ball is open to a trade from the Charlotte Hornets, sources tell Kelly Iko of Yahoo Sports. Ball has become increasingly frustrated with the franchise. For their part, sources tell Yahoo that the Hornets are open to moving Ball. Ball has $130 million remaining over the next three seasons on his contract, but is only 24 years old and could play to his talents following a change of scenery. </p>\n<p>The Hornets have a 4-11 record and Ball was benched for the final 4:32 of their 127-119 loss to the 2-13 Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>Ball is averaging 21.6 points, 6.9 reboudns, 9.6 assists in 31.4 minutes over nine games this season with the Hornets. Ball is shooting less than 30 percent on three-pointers this season and under 40 percent from the floor.</p>\n<p>Ball was the third overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft and won Rookie of the Year. After he was an All-Star in 2022, Ball has dealt with injuries and inconsistent play.</p>\n<p>Head coach Charles Lee wants the Hornets to play in a more structured offensive system that also provides opportunities and spacing for Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges and Kon Knueppel. </p>\n<p>Ball responded to the Yahoo report on X with a clown emoji. </p>",
